[{"question": "Is a reference by the parties to pleadings entered by parties in another case admissible?", "answer": "No, such references are not admissible as they make it impossible for the Court to check the exact content and significance of the submissions and arguments put forward on each side."}, {"question": "What does the expression \"the general provisions for giving effect to these Staff Regulations\" in Article 110 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the EEC and the EAEC refer to?", "answer": "The expression refers to the provisions that each institution is obliged to make in execution of certain mandatory provisions of the Regulations, such as the first paragraph of Article 2 and the second sub-paragraph of Article 5(4), and can only be recognized in cases where the provisions of the Staff Regulations are not sufficiently explicit by themselves."}, {"question": "Is Article 102 of the Staff Regulations a transitional provision that requires general provisions for giving effect to it within the meaning of Article 110 of the said Regulations?", "answer": "No, Article 102 is only a transitional provision and does not require any general provisions for giving effect to it within the meaning of Article 110 of the Staff Regulations."}, {"question": "Is the Establishment Board obliged to arrange for a confrontation between an official whose case it is considering and his superiors, except if it is clear that the absence of such a meeting would make it impossible to clarify the facts in dispute?", "answer": "Yes, the Establishment Board is obliged to arrange for a confrontation between an official and his superiors only if it is clear that the absence of such a meeting would make it impossible to clarify the facts in dispute."}, {"question": "Can the Court substitute its own assessment for the assessments of the Establishment Board, and what is the Court's role in checking the facts taken into account by the Establishment Board?", "answer": "No, the Court cannot substitute its own assessment for the assessments of the Establishment Board, which constitute a general value-judgment. The Court's role is to check whether the facts taken into account by the Establishment Board are materially accurate and logically compatible with that judgment."}, {"question": "Can a measure that has not been shown to be unlawful constitute a wrongful act or omission and unlawfully prejudice the honor and reputation of the person to whom it refers?", "answer": "No, a measure that has not been shown to be unlawful cannot constitute a wrongful act or omission and unlawfully prejudice the honor and reputation of the person to whom it refers, unless it contains superfluous criticisms of that person."}, {"question": "Is the defendant obliged to reimburse the applicant's removal expenses and pay the installation allowance, and what are the conditions for such reimbursement and payment?", "answer": "No, the defendant is not obliged to reimburse the applicant's removal expenses and pay the installation allowance.

beneficiary not being integrated under the Staff Regulations."}, {"question": "Do Articles 3(f) and 5 of the EEC Treaty prohibit national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuels?", "answer": "The court rules that Articles 3(f) and 5 of the EEC Treaty do not prohibit national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuels."}, {"question": "Under what conditions does Article 30 of the EEC Treaty prohibit national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuels?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 30 of the EEC Treaty prohibits national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuels where the minimum price is determined on the basis of an ex-refinery price fixed at a specific amount, in particular on the basis of the prices and costs of national producers, and thus neutralizes the competitive advantage which may result from the lower cost prices of imported products."}, {"question": "Can legislation fixing a minimum price for fuel be regarded as meeting an objective of public policy for the purposes of Article 36 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that legislation fixing a minimum price for fuel cannot be regarded as meeting an objective of public policy for the purposes of Article 36 of the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Can positive monetary compensatory amounts be applied to exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese from one Member State to another when no negative compensatory amounts and no minimum price rules were applied to the product on its importation into the first Member State?", "answer": "The court rules that yes, positive monetary compensatory amounts may be applied to exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese when no negative compensatory amounts or minimum price rules were applied to the product at the time of its importation, unless it can be shown that the import and export transactions were effected for the sole purpose of wrongfully securing an advantage under the relevant regulations."}, {"question": "Do the amendments to the Joint Discipline Arrangement between New Zealand and the Community concerning cheese affect the application of monetary compensatory amounts on exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese?", "answer": "The court states that the suspension of the minimum price rules does not in itself have any direct and necessary effect on the granting of monetary compensatory amounts on exports, which are intended to offset the effects of currency fluctuations on trade in agricultural products within the Community."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can the application of monetary compensatory amounts on exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese be denied?", "answer": "The court rules that the application of monetary compensatory amounts on exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese can be denied if it can be shown that the import and export transactions were effected for the sole purpose of wrongfully securing an advantage under the relevant regulations, indicating that the transactions were not bona fide commercial transactions."}, {"question": "How do the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 900/84 and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1371/81 apply to exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese?", "answer": "The court interprets these regulations as meaning that positive monetary compensatory amounts may be applied to exports of New Zealand cheddar cheese when no negative compensatory amounts or minimum price rules were applied to the product at the time of its importation, indicating that the regulations allow for the application of monetary compensatory amounts on exports under certain conditions."}, {"question": "Can Article 37 of the EEC Treaty apply to a monopoly over the provision of services, such as funeral services?", "answer": "Article 37 refers to trade in goods and cannot relate to a monopoly over the provision of services, although a monopoly over services may have an indirect influence on trade in goods between Member States."}, {"question": "Does Article 85 of the EEC Treaty apply to contracts for concessions concluded between communes and undertakings for the operation of a public service?", "answer": "No, Article 85 does not apply to contracts for concessions concluded between communes acting in their capacity as public authorities and undertakings entrusted with the operation of a public service."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can Article 86 of the EEC Treaty apply to a group of undertakings holding communal monopolies for funeral services?", "answer": "Article 86 applies if the group's activities and monopoly affect the importation of goods from other Member States or the possibility for competing undertakings to provide services, if the group occupies a dominant position characterized by economic strength that enables it to hinder effective competition, and if the group charges unfair prices."}, {"question": "Can public authorities impose conditions on undertakings to which they have granted exclusive rights, such as a monopoly in the provision of funeral services, that are contrary to Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "No, Article 90(1) of the EEC Treaty precludes public authorities from imposing on undertakings to which they have granted exclusive rights any conditions as to price that are contrary to Articles 85 and 86."}, {"question": "How should the dominant position of a group of undertakings be assessed in the context of Article 86 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The dominant position should be assessed by considering the size of the market share held by the group, the influence of the monopolistic situation on the position of the group with regard to supplies of goods and services, the position of the group in communes without exclusive concessions, and the financial resources of the group."}, {"question": "Can the level of prices fixed by contract specifications be considered as imposed by the undertaking, even if the commune has a role in setting the prices?", "answer": "Yes, the level of prices is indeed attributable to the undertaking, as the undertaking assumes full responsibility for the contracts it has concluded, and the commune's role in setting prices does not absolve the undertaking of its responsibility."}, {"question": "Does Article 30 of the Treaty prohibit national legislation that restricts retail premises from opening on Sundays?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 30 of the Treaty does not apply to national legislation prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sundays."}, {"question": "Can a national prohibition on Sunday retail trading be considered a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction on imports within the meaning of Article 30 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The court has previously ruled that the prohibition which Article 30 lays down does not apply to national rules prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sunday, where the restrictive effects on Community trade do not exceed the effects intrinsic to rules of that kind."}, {"question": "Does a national prohibition on Sunday retail trading benefit from any exceptions to Article 30 contained in Article 36, or from any other exception recognized by Community law?", "answer": "The court's ruling suggests that such a prohibition does not require justification under Article 36, as it falls outside the scope of Article 30."}, {"question": "If a national prohibition on Sunday retail trading contravenes Article 30 and is not justified under Article 36, what is the extent of its unenforceability against a trader in the Member State?", "answer": "The court did not find it necessary to reply to this question, as it had already ruled that Article 30 does not apply to national legislation prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sundays."}, {"question": "Can national legislation prohibiting the employment of staff on Sundays be considered a restriction on trade between Member States?", "answer": "The court has previously ruled that Article 30 of the Treaty must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition which it lays down does not apply to national legislation prohibiting the employment of staff on Sundays."}, {"question": "Can a national law prohibit insurance undertakings from holding, as their free assets, shares representing more than 5% of all the voting rights in a domestic or foreign public limited company without administrative authorisation, under Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267?", "answer": "The court rules that a national law may not prohibit insurance undertakings from holding, as their free assets, shares representing more than 5% of all the voting rights in a domestic or foreign public limited company without administrative authorisation, as this would contradict the clear and binding terms of Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267."}, {"question": "Are Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267 sufficiently precise and unconditional to be relied upon before a national court as against national authorities, rendering inapplicable any contrary rule of domestic law?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267 are sufficiently precise and unconditional to be relied upon before a national court as against national authorities, rendering inapplicable any contrary rule of domestic law, as the obligation imposed on Member States by these provisions is laid down in clear and unconditional terms and does not require any particular measure to implement it."}, {"question": "Can a Member State impose quantitative restrictions on the investment of free assets by insurance undertakings, such as limiting the percentage of voting rights they can hold in a company?", "answer": "The court rules that the amended Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and the amended Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267 provide that Member States must abstain from enacting any rules as to the choice of assets constituting the free assets of insurance undertakings, whether in relation to the quality or to the quantity of such assets, thus prohibiting quantitative restrictions."}, {"question": "Can the purpose of preventing insurance undertakings from carrying on commercial business other than insurance business, as stated in the amended Article 8(1)(b) of Directives 73/239 and 79/267, justify a national rule limiting the holdings of insurance undertakings in companies carrying on business other than insurance?", "answer": "The court rules that this purpose does not justify such a rule, as the prohibition is intended to protect the interests of insured persons against the risks which the exercise of such business could entail for the solvency of insurance undertakings, and does not prevent insurance undertakings from holding shares in public limited companies carrying on commercial business other than insurance business."}, {"question": "Does the fact that national authorities have discretionary power to grant derogations from a rule limiting the holdings of insurance undertakings render the rule compatible with Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267?", "answer": "The court rules that the mere fact that competent national authorities enjoy a discretionary power to grant derogations from such a rule cannot render it compatible with Article 18(1) of Directive 73/239 and Article 21(1) of Directive 79/267."}, {"question": "Are customs duties prohibited regardless of their purpose or the destination of the revenue obtained from them?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that customs duties are prohibited independently of any consideration of the purpose for which they were introduced and the destination of the revenue obtained therefrom."}, {"question": "What constitutes a charge having an equivalent effect to a customs duty within the meaning of Articles 9 and 12 of the Treaty?", "answer": "Any pecuniary charge, however small and whatever its designation and mode of application, which is imposed unilaterally on domestic or foreign goods by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier, and which is not a customs duty in the strict sense, constitutes a charge having an equivalent effect."}, {"question": "Does the prohibition of new customs duties or charges having equivalent effect permit any exceptions?", "answer": "No, the court rules that the prohibition of new customs duties or charges having equivalent effect, linked to the principle of the free movement of goods, constitutes a fundamental rule which does not permit any exceptions."}, {"question": "Are taxation measures that are imposed in the same way on imported and domestic products, or that fall within the framework of general internal taxation, considered charges having an equivalent effect?", "answer": "No, the concept of a charge having an equivalent effect does not include taxation which is imposed in the same way on imported and domestic products, or that falls within the framework of general internal taxation."}, {"question": "Can a specific service rendered warrant the payment of a fee in proportion to the service actually rendered?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that the rendering of a specific service may in certain specific cases warrant the payment of a fee in proportion to the service actually rendered, but this may only apply in specific cases that do not lead to the circumvention of the provisions of Articles 9 and 12 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "Do the provisions of the Treaty laying down prohibitions on customs duties and charges having equivalent effect directly confer rights on individuals?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that the provisions of the Treaty laying down prohibitions on customs duties and charges having equivalent effect impose precise and clearly-defined obligations on Member States, which do not require any subsequent intervention by Community or national authorities for their implementation, and therefore directly confer rights on individuals concerned."}, {"question": "Are pecuniary charges other than customs duties applied by a Member State before the introduction of the common customs tariff on goods imported directly from third countries incompatible with the requirements concerning the gradual alignment of national customs tariffs on the common external tariff?", "answer": "No, the court rules that, without prejudice to any limitations which might be imposed in order to attain the objectives of the common customs tariff, pecuniary charges other than customs duties in the strict sense applied by a Member State before the introduction of that tariff on goods imported directly from third countries are not, according to the Treaty, incompatible with the requirements concerning the gradual alignment of national customs tariffs on the common external tariff."}, {"question": "Can a balance of less than 40 tonnes denatured on any one day be taken into consideration when granting a denaturing premium?", "answer": "Yes, a balance of less than 40 tonnes denatured on any one day may be taken into consideration if it arose as a result of a rational use of the undertaking's denaturing capacity."}, {"question": "What conditions must be met for a balance of less than 40 tonnes denatured on any one day to be eligible for a denaturing premium?", "answer": "The maximum duration of the whole process must be equivalent to an average of at least 40 tonnes per day, and the balance must have arisen as a result of a rational use of the undertaking's denaturing capacity."}, {"question": "Is the owner of an undertaking entitled to a denaturing premium if they denature a quantity of less than 40 tonnes in a single day?", "answer": "The entitlement to a premium depends on whether the denaturing process meets the conditions set out in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1403/69, including the requirement for a rational use of capacity and an average of at least 40 tonnes per day over the duration of the process."}, {"question": "Can the competent intervention agency grant a denaturing premium for a total amount of less than 40 tonnes?", "answer": "Yes, the agency may grant a premium for a total amount of less than 40 tonnes when issuing the denaturing permit, but this does not necessarily mean that the premium will be granted for a balance of less than 40 tonnes on any one day."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the provision requiring a minimum quantity of 40 tonnes of cereals to be denatured each working day?", "answer": "The purpose is to avoid an increase in the amount of supervision required for the denaturing process, which entails considerable expense, and to ensure that denaturing is carried out in a way that is cost-effective and rational."}, {"question": "Do the exemptions provided for in Article 13 of the Sixth Directive constitute exceptions to the general principle that turnover tax is levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person?", "answer": "Yes, the exemptions provided for in Article 13 of the Sixth Directive constitute exceptions to the general principle that turnover tax is levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person, and therefore, the terms used to specify the exemptions are to be interpreted strictly."}, {"question": "Can a foundation that supplies services exclusively to another foundation, without being a member of the other foundation, be considered an independent group of persons supplying services to their members under Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive?", "answer": "No, a foundation that supplies services exclusively to another foundation, without being a member of the other foundation, cannot be considered an independent group of persons supplying services to their members under Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive, as the conditions for exemption are precisely formulated to require a different relationship."}, {"question": "Does the exemption provided for by Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive apply to a foundation that supplies services on a subcontractual basis to another foundation that enjoys the exemption as an independent group of social and cultural institutions?", "answer": "No, the exemption provided for by Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive does not apply to a foundation that supplies services on a subcontractual basis to another foundation that enjoys the exemption as an independent group of social and cultural institutions, as this would broaden the scope of the exemption in a way that is incompatible with the objective of the provision."}, {"question": "Do the transactions that must be exempted from turnover tax pursuant to Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive cover the activities of a foundation that consist exclusively in the organization and performance of work related to the activities of another foundation, against reimbursement of expenses actually incurred?", "answer": "No, the transactions that must be exempted from turnover tax pursuant to Article 13(A)(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive do not cover the activities of a foundation that consist exclusively in the organization and performance of work related to the activities of another foundation, against reimbursement of expenses actually incurred, where the other foundation acts as an umbrella organization for a number of bodies exercising an activity that is exempt or for which they are not taxable."}, {"question": "Can the Commission be considered to have been delegated legislative powers by the Council when it was entrusted with the practical implementation of rules laid down in a regulation?", "answer": "No, the Council did not delegate legislative powers to the Commission, but rather entrusted it with the practical implementation of the rules within the limits of its jurisdiction under the Treaty."}, {"question": "Is the duty to state reasons for a decision that adversely affects an official fulfilled when the reasons on which the measure is based are shown clearly and unambiguously?", "answer": "Yes, the duty to state reasons is fulfilled when the reasons on which the measure is based are shown clearly and unambiguously, without the need for the administration to provide particulars of its assessment of the individual in comparison to others."}, {"question": "Can the Court substitute its own valuation judgment for that of the Commission when reviewing a decision terminating an official's service?", "answer": "No, the Court may not substitute its own valuation judgment for that of the Commission, but it can check whether the decision was taken having regard to the criteria laid down in the relevant regulation and with the object of rationalizing the Commission's departments."}, {"question": "What is the standard for determining whether a decision terminating an official's service is arbitrary or not based on the requirements of department rationalization?", "answer": "The decision is not arbitrary if it is based on the criteria laid down in the relevant regulation and the Commission has considered the individual case on its merits, taking into account factors such as the abolition of the post, the individual's age, vocational training, and family responsibilities."}, {"question": "Can the Court review the Commission's assessment of an individual's suitability for a particular post when reviewing a decision terminating their service?", "answer": "Yes, the Court can review whether the Commission's decision was taken having regard to the criteria laid down in the relevant regulation, but it will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Commission on the individual's suitability for a particular post."}, {"question": "Is the Commission required to provide a detailed comparison of an individual's qualifications and experience with those of other officials of equal rank when justifying a decision to terminate their service?", "answer": "No, the Commission is not required to provide such a comparison, as this would entail complex value judgments relating to individual cases that are not necessary for the statement of reasons for the contested decision."}, {"question": "Can a Turkish worker who has been in legal employment in a Member State for an uninterrupted period of more than four years and has achieved the legal status conferred by the third indent of Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80 forfeit that status if they are detained pending trial for more than a year in connection with an offence for which they are ultimately convicted and given a suspended prison sentence?", "answer": "The court rules that a Turkish worker in such circumstances does not cease to be duly registered as belonging to the labor force of the host Member State if they find a job again within a reasonable period after their release, and may claim an extension of their residence permit for the purposes of continuing to exercise their right of free access to any paid employment of their choice."}, {"question": "Is the expulsion of a Turkish worker, who enjoys a right granted directly by Decision No 1/80, compatible with Article 14(1) of that decision when it is ordered, following a criminal conviction, solely on general preventive grounds, i.e., as a deterrent to other aliens?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 14(1) of Decision No 1/80 is to be interpreted as precluding the expulsion of a Turkish national who enjoys a right granted directly by that decision when such expulsion is ordered, following a criminal conviction, as a deterrent to other aliens without the personal conduct of the person concerned giving reason to consider that they will commit other serious offenses prejudicial to the requirements of public policy in the host Member State."}, {"question": "What conditions must be met for a Turkish worker to maintain their rights under Article 6(1) of Decision No 1/80 after a period of detention pending trial?", "answer": "The Turkish worker must find a new job within a reasonable period after their release, and their temporary absence from the labor force due to detention does not automatically lead to the loss of their rights acquired under Article 6(1)."}, {"question": "Can a Member State restrict the rights conferred on Turkish workers by Decision No 1/80 on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health?", "answer": "A Member State can restrict these rights only if the personal conduct of the Turkish worker represents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society, and not solely on general preventive grounds or as a deterrent to other aliens."}, {"question": "How should the concept of \"public policy\" in Article 14(1) of Decision No 1/80 be interpreted in relation to Turkish workers?", "answer": "The concept of \"public policy\" should be interpreted restrictively, in line with the interpretation given to that exception in the field of freedom of movement for workers who are nationals of a Member State, requiring a genuine and sufficiently serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society."}, {"question": "Can an agreement be exempt from the prohibition in Article 85(1) of the EEC Treaty without notification in accordance with Regulation No 17 and Regulation No 1133/68?", "answer": "The court rules that in the absence of notification in accordance with the requirements of Regulation No 17 and Regulation No 1133/68, an agreement may not have exemption under Article 85(3) of the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Under what circumstances can an agreement escape the prohibition in Article 85(1) of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court states that an agreement may escape the prohibition in Article 85(1) when it affects the market only to an insignificant extent, having regard to the weak position of those concerned in the market for the products in question."}, {"question": "Does the consideration of insignificant market effect apply to products of a large undertaking responsible for the entire production?", "answer": "The court rules that the same considerations do not apply in the case of a product of a large undertaking responsible for the entire production, and therefore, there is no reason to distinguish between such a product and others."}, {"question": "Can procedural irregularities in the administrative procedure lead to a different result in the Commission's decision?", "answer": "The court states that the position would be different only if, in the absence of those irregularities, the administrative proceedings could have led to a different result, but in this case, the applicant's omission to notify the price terms to the Commission deprived it of any possibility of obtaining a decision granting exemption under Article 85(3)."}, {"question": "What is the consequence of not notified price terms to the Commission in accordance with Regulation No 17 and Regulation No 1133/68?", "answer": "The court rules that the price terms may not have exemption under Article 85(3) of the EEC Treaty, and the Commission's decision based on the absence of notification could not have been different, even in the absence of procedural irregularities."}, {"question": "Does Article 30 of the EEC Treaty preclude the application of a national rule that prohibits an undertaking from using advertisements with eye-catching price comparisons for goods imported from another Member State?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that Article 30 of the EEC Treaty precludes the application of such a rule, as it may constitute an obstacle to imports and is not proportionate to the aim of protecting consumers."}, {"question": "Can a national rule that restricts or prohibits certain forms of advertising or sales promotion be considered a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction on imports?", "answer": "Yes, the court holds that such a rule can be considered a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction, as it may affect marketing opportunities for imported products and restrict their volume."}, {"question": "Is a national rule that prohibits eye-catching price comparisons in advertisements justified by the need to protect consumers against misleading advertising?", "answer": "No, the court rules that the prohibition is not justified, as it applies to both correct and incorrect price comparisons, and there are less restrictive measures that can achieve the same goal of protecting consumers."}, {"question": "Can a national rule that prohibits correct price comparisons in advertisements be considered a proportionate measure to achieve the aim of protecting fair trading and competition?", "answer": "No, the court holds that correct price comparisons cannot distort the conditions of competition, and a rule prohibiting such comparisons may actually restrict competition."}, {"question": "Does the magnitude of the effects of a national rule on intra-Community trade affect the application of Article 30 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "No, the court rules that Article 30 of the EEC Treaty does not make a distinction between measures based on the magnitude of their effects on trade within the Community."}, {"question": "Can a national law prohibit the disclosure of the identity of declarants or consignees of imported goods that are found to be counterfeit to the trade-mark owner?", "answer": "The court rules that Council Regulation (EC) No 3295/94 precludes a rule of national law under which the identity of declarants or consignees of imported goods that are found to be counterfeit may not be disclosed to the trade-mark owner."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of disclosing the identity of declarants or consignees to the trade-mark owner?", "answer": "The disclosure is necessary to enable the trade-mark owner to refer the case to the competent national authority so that it can give a final judgment against the counterfeit practices."}, {"question": "Does the Regulation allow for the protection of personal data, commercial and industrial secrecy, and professional and administrative confidentiality?", "answer": "Yes, the Regulation refers to national provisions on the protection of personal data, commercial and industrial secrecy, and professional and administrative confidentiality, but these provisions cannot preclude the disclosure of information necessary for the trade-mark owner to safeguard its interests."}, {"question": "What measures are in place to protect the declarant and consignee of goods from damage resulting from the disclosure of their identities?", "answer": "The Regulation provides that the holder of the right may use the disclosed information only to ask the competent national authority to take a substantive decision, and that the holder of the right may incur liability under civil law if the information is used for other purposes. Additionally, the Member States may require the holder of the right to provide a security to cover any liability or costs incurred."}, {"question": "Can the declarant or consignee of goods have them released or their detention revoked against provision of a security?", "answer": "Yes, according to Article 7(2) of the Regulation, the owner, importer, or consignee of the goods is entitled to have the goods released or their detention revoked against provision of a security, provided that certain conditions are met."}, {"question": "How should the concept of 'nationals' in Article 4(a) of Annex VII of the Staff Regulations be interpreted to avoid unwarranted differences in treatment between male and female officials?", "answer": "The concept of 'nationals' must be interpreted in such a way as to avoid any unwarranted difference of treatment as between male and female officials who are, in fact, placed in comparable situations, excluding nationality imposed by law on a female official upon her marriage with a national of another state and which she was unable to renounce."}, {"question": "Can a female official be considered as having acquired a new nationality solely due to her marriage to a national of another state, if she has no possibility of renouncing it?", "answer": "No, in determining entitlement to an expatriation allowance, the female official's nationality imposed by law upon her marriage should not be taken into account if she has no possibility of renouncing it."}, {"question": "What is the primary consideration in determining entitlement to an expatriation allowance under Article 4 of Annex VII?", "answer": "The official's habitual residence before they entered the service is the paramount consideration in determining entitlement to an expatriation allowance."}, {"question": "Can the Staff Regulations of Officials treat officials differently in terms of expatriation allowance based on their sex?", "answer": "No, the Staff Regulations of Officials cannot treat officials differently in this respect according to whether they are of the male or female sex, as payment of the expatriation allowance must be determined by considerations which are uniform and disregard the difference in sex."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the expatriation allowance?", "answer": "The object of the expatriation allowance is to compensate officials for the extra expense and inconvenience of taking up employment with the Communities and being thereby obliged to change their residence."}, {"question": "Should the defendant be ordered to pay legal interest on the arrears of expatriation allowance in this case?", "answer": "No, the application for legal interest is dismissed, as the defendant interpreted the provision in question erroneously but in good faith."}, {"question": "Can a Member State deport a national of another Member State for the purpose of deterring other aliens from committing similar offenses, based on reasons of a 'general preventive nature'?", "answer": "Article 3 (1) and (2) of Directive No 64/221/EEC prevents the deportation of a national of a Member State if such deportation is ordered for the purpose of deterring other aliens, i.e., for reasons of a 'general preventive nature'."}, {"question": "Is the deportation of a national of a Member State possible only when there are clear indications that the individual will commit further offenses or disregard public security or public policy, i.e., for reasons of a'special preventive nature'?", "answer": "The directive implies that measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned, suggesting that deportation is only justified when there are specific reasons related to the individual's conduct, rather than general preventive purposes."}, {"question": "Can previous criminal convictions alone constitute grounds for deporting a national of a Member State?", "answer": "According to Article 3 (2) of Directive No 64/221/EEC, previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for the taking of measures such as deportation."}, {"question": "What is the primary consideration for determining whether a deportation order can be made against a national of a Member State?", "answer": "The concept of 'personal conduct' is the determining factor, and a deportation order may only be made for breaches of the peace and public security which might be committed by the individual affected."}, {"question": "Does Article 30 of the Treaty preclude national legislation that reserves the sale of optical appliances and corrective lenses solely to holders of an optician's certificate?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that Article 30 of the Treaty precludes national legislation which reserves the sale of optical appliances and corrective lenses solely to holders of an optician's certificate, as it may affect

the sale of contact lenses and related products in commercial establishments not run or managed by qualified opticians be justified on grounds of public health under Article 36 of the Treaty?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that national legislation which prohibits the sale of contact lenses and related products in commercial establishments not run or managed by persons who fulfil the conditions laid down for practising as opticians is justified on grounds of the protection of public health, as it is intended to ensure the protection of public health and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective."}, {"question": "What is the principle that Member States must comply with when deciding on the degree of protection to afford to public health in the absence of common or harmonized rules?", "answer": "The principle of proportionality; Member States must comply with this principle and ensure that their legislation is appropriate for the purpose of protecting

imputable to the Member State?", "answer": "The principle is that it is for the applicant Member State to show that the conditions for obtaining the financing disallowed are satisfied, and the Member State must adduce evidence to contradict the Commission's findings and justify the expenditure."}, {"question": "Does the European Court of Justice have jurisdiction to interpret national law in force in a Member State, including constitutional laws?", "answer": "The court rules that it does not have the function of ensuring respect for national law in force in a Member State, and therefore may

law, as it arises under the ECSC Treaty, does not contain any general principle, whether explicit or otherwise, guaranteeing the maintenance of vested rights."}, {"question": "What is the High Authority's duty when authorizing specialization agreements or joint-buying or joint-selling agreements?", "answer": "The High Authority has an absolute duty to state specific reasons for these authorizations, which must enable interested parties and the Court to verify the factors that led to the conclusion that the conditions required for authorization were met."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority restrict trade by imposing quantitative criteria on joint selling agencies?", "answer": "The court rules that the advantages derived from trading with the lowest possible number of wholesalers do not constitute a sufficient reason to justify the restriction imposed on trade, particularly since the purpose of the joint selling agencies is to furnish wholesalers with supplies."}, {"question": "Is the High Authority required to provide sufficient reasons for reducing quantitative criteria?", "answer": "The court states that the High Authority must provide sufficient reasons for reducing quantitative criteria, and that the mere reference to rules in force prior to the establishment of the Common Market is not conclusive."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority authorize quantitative criteria that tend to prevent, restrict, or distort competition between joint selling agencies?", "answer": "The court rules that the High Authority may not authorize quantitative criteria that tend to prevent, restrict, or distort competition between joint selling agencies, as this would be contrary to the requirements of Article 65(2) of the Treaty."}, {"question": "What is the test for determining whether the High Authority has misused its powers?", "answer": "The court states that the test for determining whether the High Authority has misused its powers is whether it has used its powers for a purpose other than that for which they were conferred, and that the allegation of misuse of powers must be supported by proof."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority impose new commercial rules for an illicit purpose, such as implementing a policy of aid to the middle classes?", "answer": "The court rules that the High Authority may not impose new commercial rules for an illicit purpose, and that the allegation of misuse of powers must be supported by proof that the High Authority pursued a purpose other than that for which its powers were conferred."}, {"question":

Member State refuse to refund VAT to a taxable person not established in its territory who has subcontracted part of their work to a taxable person established in that Member State?", "answer": "No, a Member State fails to fulfil its obligations under the Eighth Directive, in particular Article 2, by refusing to refund to taxable persons established in another Member State the VAT which they have been required to pay where they have subcontracted part of the work covered by a contract to a taxable person established in the territory of the country."}, {"question": "Where should a composite supply of services relating to waste disposal be deemed to be supplied for VAT purposes when the holder of the main contract has its business or a fixed establishment in a Member State other than where the waste is physically disposed of?", "answer": "The services which the holder of the main contract performs are deemed to be supplied in the Member State where the holder has its business or a

determination of the place of supply of services for VAT purposes?", "answer": "No, the fact that a main contractor entrusts the physical performance of a contract to a subcontractor in another Member State does not affect the determination of the place of supply of services for VAT purposes, which is determined by the place where the supplier has established its business or has a fixed establishment."}, {"question": "Can a Member State justify non-compliance with Community Directives by citing provisions or circumstances within its internal legal system?", "answer": "No, a Member

objective characteristics and properties of products, which can be ascertained when customs clearance is obtained, and that these criteria are not subjective."}, {"question": "Is Additional Note 6(a) contrary to the Convention on the Nomenclature?", "answer": "The court rules that Additional Note 6(a) does not change the scope of the chapters, sections, and headings of the Nomenclature, but merely specifies the criteria to be taken into account for classifying certain goods under a particular heading of the Common Customs Tariff in accordance with the interpretation given by the Customs

restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions."}, {"question": "How do national authorities determine whether a product is a medicinal product or a foodstuff?", "answer": "The Court rules that in order to decide whether a product is to be categorized as a medicinal product or as a foodstuff, it is necessary to have regard to its pharmacological properties, and the fact that a product

Member States required to consult specialized committees before classifying a product as a medicinal product?", "answer": "No, the Court states that there is no provision obliging Member States to consult the consultative committees specialized in medicinal products attached to the Community institutions before taking steps dictated by the definitions of medicinal product given in Directive

Court states that a monopoly of the right to distribute medicinal or other products, granted to dispensing pharmacists, may constitute a barrier to importation."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can a monopoly granted to pharmacists be justified?", "answer": "The Court rules that if a Member State chooses to restrict to pharmacists the right to distribute products, such a barrier is, in principle and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, justified insofar as it concerns medicinal products within the meaning of Council Directive 65/65, but for other products, it is for the national court to determine whether the monopoly is necessary for the protection of public health or consumers and whether those aims cannot be achieved by measures less restrictive of intra-Community trade."}, {"question": "Does Council Directive 74/329 prevent a Member State from restricting trade in a product such as guar gum, used as part of a method intended to facilitate weight loss?", "answer": "The Court rules that Directive 74/329 does not prevent a Member State from restricting trade in such a product, but the restriction must be necessary to protect public health or consumers

Commission need to consider when assessing the need for import restrictions under Article 74 of the ECSC Treaty?", "answer": "The Commission must consider the possibility of disposing of existing

have on Community exports."}, {"question": "Does Article 58(2) of the ECSC Treaty restrict the Commission's freedom to choose the basis for determining production quotas?", "answer": "No, Article

production to be reduced without altering the positions of undertakings on the market."}, {"question": "Does the application of Decision No 2794/80 lead to discrimination against Greek undertakings?", "answer": "No, the application of Decision No 2794/80 does not lead to discrimination against Greek undertakings, as the measures taken to enable the reference production of undertakings belonging to the old Community to be assessed on an equitable basis cannot be regarded as discrimination against Greek undertakings."}, {"question": "Can the Commission be hindered in its power to bring proceedings before the Court under Article 169 of the Treaty due to the outcome of consultations within the Article 113 Committee or the need for a consensus among Member States on the interpretation of the Community's commitments under an international agreement?", "answer": "No, the Commission must not be hindered in the exercise of its power under Article 169 of the Treaty to bring proceedings

2228/91 on goods imported under inward processing relief arrangements using the suspension system?", "answer": "Article 16 of Regulation No 2228/91 does not exempt goods imported under inward processing relief arrangements using the suspension system from the IDA, as the IDA's purpose is to ensure minimum price levels in international trade, not to protect the Community market."},

Commission is required to establish the existence of the alleged infringement and may not rely on any presumption in proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "Does the prohibition of discrimination in Article 40(3) of the EEC Treaty preclude a Member State from choosing 1981 as the reference year for determining reference quantities if it leads to discrimination between

discrimination between producers within the Community, considering the specific conditions on its market and the structure of agricultural activities in its territory."}, {"question": "Can a Member State that has chosen 1981 as the reference year determine purchasers' reference quantities by weighting the quantity of milk purchased during that year by a percentage that varies based on the level of deliveries of certain categories of persons liable for the levy?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 2 of Council Regulation No 857/84 precludes a Member State that has chosen 1981 as the reference year from determining purchasers' reference quantities by weighting, except for cases expressly provided for in the rules, as this option is only available if the Member State has adopted 1982 or 1983 as the reference year."}, {"question": "Does Council Regulation No 857/84 enable a Member State that has opted for Formula B to assign the individual reference quantity of a producer who has discontinued production to the reference quantity of the purchaser to whom that producer was delivering milk, instead of adding it to the national reserve?", "answer": "The court rules that Council Regulation No 857/84 precludes a Member State that has opted for Formula B from adding the individual reference quantity of a producer who has ceased production to the reference quantity of the purchaser, instead of adding it to the national reserve, as this would create discrimination between producers."}, {"question": "Does Council Regulation No 857/84 permit a Member State to add the individual reference quantity of a supplier who has discontinued production to the reserve of the last purchaser, even if additional quantities drawn from the national reserve have been added to that producer's individual reference quantity?", "answer": "The court rules that Council Regulation No 857/84 precludes a Member State from adding the individual reference quantity of a producer who has ceased production to the reference quantity of the purchaser, instead of adding it to the national reserve, and does not address the specific scenario of adding quantities to the reserve of the last purchaser, as the focus is on preventing discrimination by ensuring that ceased production quantities are added to the national reserve."}, {"question": "Does a national law that prohibits the marketing of non-agricultural pesticides without prior authorization constitute a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction within the meaning of Article 30 of the EC Treaty?", "answer": "Yes, such a provision constitutes a measure having an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction within the meaning of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, as it is capable of hindering trade between Member States."}, {"question": "Can a Member State justify a national provision that prohibits the marketing of biocidal products containing dangerous substances without prior authorization under Article 36 of the EC Treaty, even if the product has already been authorized for sale in another Member State?", "answer": "Yes, national legislation prohibiting the marketing of a biocidal product containing dangerous substances without prior authorization from the competent authorities is justified under Article 36 of the EC Treaty, even if that product has already been authorized for

status."}, {"question": "Can the basis of the service relationship between the Community and its officials or servants reside in a decision of a national court?", "answer": "The court rules that the basis of the service relationship between the Community and its officials or servants other than local staff cannot reside in a decision of a national court."}, {"question": "What is the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in disputes between the Community and its servants?", "answer": "The Court of Justice has jurisdiction in any dispute between the Community and its servants within the limits and under the conditions laid down in the staff regulations or the conditions of employment."}, {"question": "Do the staff regulations and conditions of employment apply to local staff?", "answer":

transferred with the holding to the producer taking it over, but is instead added to the national reserve by means of a clawback mechanism, when determining the detailed rules for transferring reference quantities upon the sale or lease of a holding pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation No 3950/92?", "answer": "Yes, a Member State may provide for such a mechanism, but it must be adopted and applied in a way that does not compromise the objectives of the common agricultural policy, on the basis of objective criteria, and in accordance with the general principles of Community law, including legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, proportionality, non-discrimination, and respect for fundamental rights."}, {"question": "Is the procedure chosen by a Member State to adopt national measures pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation No 3950/92, such as a legislative instrument authorizing a competent authority to adopt measures by decision, subject to the principles of Community law, including the principle of legal certainty?", "answer": "The principle of legal certainty requires that the publicity for such measures be of a nature that informs the natural or legal persons concerned by the measures of their rights and obligations under them, but it does not preclude a Member State from choosing a procedure where a legislative instrument authorizes a competent authority to adopt measures by decision."}, {"question": "What conditions must be met for a Member State to adopt a clawback measure, such as the one at issue, in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation No 3950/92?", "answer": "The measure must be adopted and applied in a way that does not compromise the objectives of the common agricultural policy, on the basis of objective criteria, and in accordance with the general principles of Community law, including legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, proportionality, non-discrimination, and respect for fundamental rights."}, {"question": "Can a national procedure whereby a Member State empowers a competent authority to make a determination regarding the transfer of reference quantities, and provides for such determination to be made by administrative notice published in a national newspaper, be contrary to the principle of legal certainty in Community law?", "answer": "The principle of legal certainty does not preclude such a procedure, but it requires that the publicity for the measures be of a nature that informs the natural or legal persons concerned by the measures of their rights and obligations under them, and it is for the national court to determine whether this condition is met in the specific case."}, {"question": "What is the obligation of Member States under Council Directive 93/40/EEC regarding the transposition of the Directive into national law?", "answer": "Member States are to take all appropriate measures to comply with the Directive, with the exception of

effect of a Member State's failure to respond to a reasoned opinion from the Commission regarding non-compliance with a Directive?", "answer": "The Commission may bring proceedings against the Member State, which may result in a declaration that the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive."}, {"question": "Can an appointing authority consider professional experience as equivalent to university education evidenced by a degree for promotion purposes?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that it is for the appointing authority to appraise whether professional experience is equivalent to university education evidenced by a degree."}, {"question": "Is the appointing authority bound to appoint a person with the specified qualifications for a post, as stated in the vacancy notice?", "answer": "No, the court rules that while the appointing authority must consider the qualifications required for the post, it is not bound to appoint a person with those exact qualifications if it determines that another candidate has equivalent practical experience."}, {"question": "What is the decisive issue in determining whether a candidate has equivalent practical experience?", "answer": "The court rules that the decisive issue is what may be regarded as \"equivalent practical experience\" in relation to the specific post and qualifications required."},

rules that it is possible for a candidate who has never practiced as an engineer to be considered as having equivalent practical experience, depending on the nature of the post and the candidate's relevant work experience."}, {"question": "Is the comparative merit of officials eligible for promotion a relevant factor in the appointment decision?", "answer": "Yes, the court rules that

{"question": "Can the Commission exempt production directed towards export markets from the quota system under Article 58 of the ECSC Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that it is not possible to infer from Article 58 any obligation on the Commission to exempt from the quota system the production which certain undertakings might prefer to direct towards export markets."}, {"question": "Can a Community measure have retroactive effect, and if so, under what conditions?", "answer": "The court states that although the principle of legal certainty precludes a Community measure from taking

respected."}, {"question": "What is the goal of the steel production quota system introduced under Article 58 of the ECSC Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that the goal of the steel production quota system is to improve market conditions so as to enable the profitability of undertakings to be maintained or restored in the long term and thereby enable the jobs which depend on it to be preserved as far as possible."}, {"question": "Is the Commission required to guarantee each individual undertaking a minimum level of production under Article 58 of the ECSC Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 58 does not require the Commission to guarantee each individual undertaking a minimum level of production determined in accordance with the undertaking's own criteria of profitability and development."}, {"question": "How should the general aims set out in Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the ECSC Treaty be reconciled?", "answer": "The court states that the general aims set out in those articles must constantly be reconciled with one another in the light of the economic circumstances and therefore priority may not be given to one of those aims to the detriment of the others."}, {"question": "Can an undertaking plead emergency due to serious economic difficulties to excuse itself from observing the production quota restrictions?", "answer": "The court rules that

if so, what are the limits of such fines?", "answer": "The court states that the Commission may impose fines not exceeding the value of the tonnages produced in disregard of the quota, and that the amount of the fine should be based on the value of the tonnages produced, not the profit realized from such production."}, {"question": "Can the court grant terms and payment periods to undertakings that have been fined, taking into account their financial position and the current situation in the industry?", "answer": "The court rules that claims of this sort are manifestly inadmissible, as the court cannot issue instructions to the Commission, which alone has the power to grant terms of payment to undertakings that have been fined."}, {"question": "What are the prerequisites for

Community action solely based on the entry of the relevant appropriation in the budget?", "answer": "No, the Commission cannot implement significant Community action solely based on the entry of the relevant appropriation in the budget. It must first obtain a basic act authorising the expenditure, with the exception of non-significant Community action."}, {"question": "What constitutes non-significant Community action?", "answer": "Non-significant Community action refers to pilot projects or preparatory actions designed to assess the policy pros and cons of a proposal for a basic measure, which can be funded solely based on the entry of the relevant appropriation in the budget."}, {"question": "How does the Court determine whether Community action is significant or non-significant?", "answer": "The Court determines whether Community action is significant or non-significant by examining the purpose, scope, and effects of the action, as well as whether it is part of a larger program or initiative. The fact that an action has limited expenditure or a short duration does not necessarily mean it is non-significant."}, {"question": "Can the Commission commit expenditure for significant Community action without a basic act authorising the expenditure?", "answer": "No, the Commission cannot commit expenditure for significant Community action without a basic act authorising the expenditure. To do so would be a breach of Article 4(1) of the EC Treaty, which requires each institution to act within the limits of the powers conferred upon it."}, {"question": "Under what circumstances can the Court preserve the effects of an annulled decision?", "answer": "The Court can preserve the effects of an annulled decision when important considerations of legal certainty are at stake, such as when

inadmissibility of an application concerning the same illegality and having the same financial end in view."}, {"question": "What are the conditions for a new factor to cause the period for bringing an appeal to start to run afresh?", "answer": "A new factor can cause the period for bringing an appeal to start to run afresh only if it is a material factor that clearly and consistently indicates the provisional nature of the original decision."}, {"question": "Can the appointment of various servants to a higher grade be considered a factor capable of causing the period for bringing an appeal to start to run afresh?", "answer": "No, the appointment of various servants to a higher grade cannot be regarded as a factor capable of causing the period for bringing an appeal to start to run afresh if it does not affect the appellant's classification and is not retroactive."}, {"question": "Can a claim for damages be based on the difference between the salary paid and the salary that would have been received in a higher grade?", "answer": "No, a claim for damages cannot be based solely on the difference between the salary paid and the salary that would have been received in a higher grade if the principal application concerning the classification is inadmissible."}, {"question": "How are costs handled in proceedings by servants of the communities?", "answer": "Under Article 70 of the Rules of Procedure, institutions shall bear their own costs in proceedings by servants of the communities, but the Court may order that the parties pay their own costs in whole or in

where preserved mushrooms have been released into free circulation without a valid import licence?", "answer": "Yes, the additional amount must also be levied where preserved mushrooms have been released into free circulation within the Community and it has been discovered, after their release into free circulation, that they were not accompanied by a valid import licence."}, {"question": "Are Regulations Nos 796/81 and 1755/81 valid, in particular as regards the level at which the additional amount is fixed, in light of the principle of proportionality?", "answer": "No, Article 1 of each of those regulations is invalid as regards the level of the additional amount fixed, as it was set at a flat rate without consideration for the origin or quality of the mushrooms, resulting in a disproportionate financial charge on importers of lower-grade mushrooms."}, {"question": "What is the objective of levying an additional amount on imports of preserved mushrooms, as pursued by Regulations Nos 796/81 and 1755/81?", "answer": "The objective is to protect the Community market in mushrooms from serious disturbances caused by imports from non-member countries, not to exclude completely imports in excess of certain quantities or to penalize imports without a licence."}, {"question": "Can the Commission fix an additional amount at a level that corresponds to the cost price of grade 1 preserved mushrooms produced in the Community, without considering the quality or origin of the imported mushrooms?", "answer": "No, such a level of additional amount is disproportionate and exceeds the limit inherent in observance of the principle of proportionality, as it significantly increases the cost of preserved mushrooms produced in non-member countries and constitutes a considerable financial charge for importers of lower-grade mushrooms."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Article 69 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 in relation to migrant workers?", "answer": "The purpose of Article 69 is to ensure the limited and conditional preservation of the unemployment benefits of the competent state for a migrant worker, even if they go to another Member State."}, {"question": "Can a Member State deny a migrant worker entitlement to benefits under its national legislation due to the worker's failure to comply with the conditions prescribed in Article 69?", "answer": "No, a Member State cannot rely on a migrant worker's failure to comply with the conditions prescribed in Article 69 to deny them entitlement to benefits under its national legislation."}, {"question": "Does Article 69 affect the rights of a migrant worker to claim benefits under the legislation of the Member State they have moved to?", "answer": "No, Article 69 does not affect any rights the worker may have under the legislation of the Member State they have moved to, and the authorities of that state should apply their national legislation in the normal way, regardless of the worker's entitlement to benefits under Article 69."}, {"question": "Is Article 71 of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 relevant to the situation of a migrant worker who has failed to comply with the conditions of Article 69?", "answer": "The court did not find it necessary to answer this question, as the answer to the question concerning Article 69 made it unnecessary to consider Article 71."}, {"question": "Can a Member State invoke the unlawfulness of a Community decision before a national court if it did not challenge the decision within the time-limit laid down by the fifth paragraph of Article 230 EC?", "answer": "No, a Member State that is an addressee of a Community decision and has not challenged its legality within the time-limit laid down by the fifth paragraph of Article 230 EC does not have standing subsequently before a national court to invoke its unlawfulness in order to dispute the merits of an action brought against it."}, {"question": "Can a Member State invoke Article 30 EC to prohibit imports of agricultural products and live animals if there are harmonizing measures in place, such as Directives 89/662 and 90/425?", "answer": "No, where Community directives provide for the harmonization of the measures necessary to ensure the protection of animal and human health and establish Community procedures to check that they are observed, recourse to Article 30 EC is no longer justified, and a Member State is not entitled to invoke Article 30 EC to prevent the resumption of imports of beef and veal from the United Kingdom that were carried out in accordance with Decisions 98/256 and 1999/514."}, {"question": "What is the significance of Decisions 98/256 and 98/692 in relation to the protection of public health upon the resumption of exports of beef and veal from the United Kingdom to other Member States?", "answer": "Decisions 98/256 and 98/692 lay down the rules necessary for the protection of public health, provide a Community procedure to monitor compliance, and specify the procedure for amending the decisions in the light of new scientific information, thereby providing the appropriate legal framework for the adoption of interim protective measures by a Member State of destination for the purpose of protecting public health."}, {"question": "What is the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes under the Combined Nomenclature (CN)?", "answer": "The decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN."}, {"question": "Can products with a high vitamin content, such as Taxofit Vitamin C + Ca Brausetabletten and Taxofit Vitamin C Kautabletten, be classified as food supplements under CN heading No 2106?", "answer": "No, products with a high vitamin content, such as Taxofit Vitamin C + Ca Brausetabletten and Taxofit Vitamin C Kautabletten, cannot be regarded as food supplements or preparations for the purposes of point 1(a) of the introductory notes to Chapter 30 of the CN, but must be viewed as products with a clearly defined therapeutic or prophylactic profile."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can vitamin preparations be classified under CN heading No 3004, which covers medicaments for therapeutic or prophylactic uses?", "answer": "Vitamin preparations can be classified under CN heading No 3004 if they have a clearly defined therapeutic or prophylactic profile, are packaged for retail sale, and their packaging and explanatory notice bear appropriate indications as to the nature of the ailments against which they are to be used, their method of use, and dosage."}, {"question": "Is the fact that a product is authorized for release on the market as a medicament relevant for its classification under the CN?", "answer": "While the fact that a product is authorized for release on the market as a medicament may be relevant, it is not a decisive factor in determining its classification under the CN; the decisive factor is the product's objective characteristics and properties, such as its therapeutic or prophylactic effect."}, {"question": "How should products such as Taxofit Vitamin C + Ca Brausetabletten and Taxofit Vitamin C Kautabletten be classified under the Combined Nomenclature?", "answer": "Products such as Taxofit Vitamin C + Ca Brausetabletten and Taxofit Vitamin C Kautabletten are to be classified under heading No 3004 of the Combined Nomenclature, as they have a clearly defined therapeutic or prophylactic profile and meet the requirements for classification under this heading."}, {"question": "What constitutes \"pay\" within the meaning of Article 119 of the EEC Treaty and Directive 75/117?", "answer": "The concept of pay comprises any consideration, whether in cash or in kind, whether immediate or future, provided that the worker receives it, albeit indirectly, in respect of their employment from their employer, and irrespective of whether the worker receives it under a contract of employment, by virtue of legislative provisions or on a voluntary basis."}, {"question": "Does compensation in the form of paid leave or overtime pay for attending training courses imparting knowledge necessary for working on staff councils constitute \"pay\" for the purposes of Article 119 and Directive 75/117?", "answer": "Yes, such compensation constitutes pay, as it is paid by the employer by virtue of legislative provisions and under a contract of employment, and is intended to ensure that staff council members receive income even when not performing work as stipulated in their contracts of employment."}, {"question": "Can national legislation limit compensation for staff council members employed on a part-time basis to their individual working hours, while staff council members employed on a full-time basis receive compensation based on full-time working hours?", "answer": "No, Article 119 of the Treaty and Council Directive 75/117 preclude national legislation applicable to a much greater number of women than men from limiting compensation for staff council members employed on a part-time basis to their individual working hours, unless the Member State proves that such legislation is justified by objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can a difference in treatment between staff council members employed on a part-time basis and those employed on a full-time basis be justified?", "answer": "A difference in treatment can be justified if the Member State proves that it is based on objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex, such as factors that are not inherently discriminatory and are necessary for the functioning of the undertaking."}, {"question": "Can the fact that compensation for participation in training courses is calculated solely on the basis of working hours not worked alter the finding of indirect discrimination against female workers?", "answer": "No, the fact that compensation is calculated based on working hours not worked does not alter the finding of indirect discrimination, as staff council members who work on a part-time basis receive less compensation than their full-time colleagues despite receiving the same number of hours of training."}, {"question": "What is the consequence for a Member State that fails to notify the Commission of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with a directive within the prescribed period?", "answer": "The court rules that such failure constitutes a failure to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "What is required for a Member State to be considered as having complied with all its obligations under a directive?", "answer": "A Member State may be considered to have complied with all its obligations under a directive only when all the provisions of that directive expressly form part of its legislation."}, {"question": "Can a Member State remedy its failure to transpose a directive into its domestic law by adopting decrees after the prescribed period has expired?", "answer": "The court does not explicitly accept this as a valid remedy, as it holds that the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations despite acknowledging that certain decrees could remedy the default."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs when a Member State fails to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty and is found guilty by the court?", "answer": "The unsuccessful party, in this case, the Italian Republic, is ordered to pay the costs."}, {"question": "What is the legal basis for the court's decision that a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court's decision is based on the mandatory nature of directives and the requirement that Member States comply with them within the prescribed periods, as well as the failure of the Italian Republic to adopt the necessary laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to comply with the directives in question."}, {"question": "Do Articles 3(F), 5, 85, and 86 of the EEC Treaty prohibit national rules that provide for a minimum price to be fixed by national authorities for the retail sale of fuel?", "answer": "The court rules that Articles 3(F), 5, 85, and 86 of the EEC Treaty do not prohibit national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuel."}, {"question": "Under what conditions does Article 30 of the EEC Treaty prohibit national rules that fix a minimum price for the retail sale of fuel?", "answer": "Article 30 of the EEC Treaty prohibits national rules providing for a minimum price to be fixed by the national authorities for the retail sale of fuel where the minimum price is fixed on the basis solely of the ex-refinery prices of the national refineries and where those ex-refinery prices are in turn linked to the ceiling price which is calculated on the basis solely of the cost prices of national refineries when the European fuel rates are more than 8% above or below those prices."}, {"question": "Can a Member State adopt legislation or rules introducing a minimum-price system for the retail sale of fuel without conflicting with Community Law?", "answer": "The court rules that a Member State can adopt legislation or rules introducing a minimum-price system for the retail sale of fuel, as long as it does not contradict the conditions set out in Article 30 of the EEC Treaty, specifically regarding the calculation of the minimum price based on ex-refinery prices and cost prices of national refineries in relation to European fuel rates."}, {"question": "Does the legal classification of a national measure in Community Law depend on its view or appraisal in the national context?", "answer": "The legal classification in Community Law of a national measure does not depend upon how that measure is viewed or appraised in the national context, and it should be interpreted independently to ensure uniform application throughout the Community."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Article 95 of the Treaty, and does it apply to measures of relief that accord more favorable treatment to domestic products than to imported products?", "answer": "Article 95 of the Treaty is intended to cover all taxation procedures that conflict with the principle of equal treatment of domestic and imported products, and it applies to measures of relief that accord more favorable treatment to similar domestic products than to imported products, even if adopted on the basis of administrative instructions."}, {"question": "How should the term \"taxation\" in Article 95 of the Treaty be interpreted in relation to the selling price for spirits fixed by a national monopoly?", "answer": "The term \"taxation\" in Article 95 of the Treaty should be regarded as covering only that part of the price that the monopoly is required by law to remit to the state treasury as a tax on spirits, to the exclusion of all other elements or charges included in the calculation of the monopoly selling price."}, {"question": "Can a measure carried out by means of discriminatory taxation be considered as forming part of an aid within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty, and if so, which provision governs such a measure?", "answer": "A measure carried out by means of discriminatory taxation may be considered as forming part of an aid within the meaning of Article 92, but it should in any case be governed by Article 95."}, {"question": "Do the rules contained in Article 37 of the Treaty concerning national monopolies apply to national provisions that have no connection with the specific business of the monopoly in question?", "answer": "The rules contained in Article 37 of the Treaty concern only activities intrinsically connected with the specific business of the monopoly in question and are thus irrelevant to national provisions that have no connection with such specific business."}, {"question": "What is the function of Article 53(1) of the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and Greece, and does it preclude a national system of relief from providing more favorable tax treatment for domestic spirits than for those imported from Greece?", "answer": "Article 53(1) of the Agreement fulfills the same function as Article 95 of the Treaty within the framework of the association agreement, and it precludes a national system of relief from providing more favorable tax treatment for domestic spirits than for those imported from Greece."}, {"question": "Can an importer of spirits from other Member States or from Greece rely on Article 95 of the Treaty or Article 53(1) of the Association Agreement against the application of national measures of tax relief for spirits that accord less favorable treatment to such spirits than to similar domestic products?", "answer": "Yes, an importer of spirits from other Member States or from Greece may rely on Article 95 of the Treaty or Article 53(1) of the Association Agreement against the application of national measures of tax relief for spirits that accord less favorable treatment to such spirits than to similar domestic products."}, {"question": "What is the objective of the second paragraph of Article 173 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The objective is to prevent Community institutions from excluding an application by an individual against a decision of direct and individual concern to them by choosing the form of a regulation, and to make clear that the choice of form may not alter the nature of a measure."}, {"question": "Can a regulation be considered a measure of general application if it is possible to determine the number or identity of the persons to whom it applies?", "answer": "Yes, a measure does not cease to be a regulation because it is possible to determine the number or even the identity of the persons to whom it applies at any given time, as long as its application takes effect by virtue of an objective legal or factual situation defined by the measure in relation to its purpose."}, {"question": "What is the test for distinguishing between a regulation and a decision under Article 189 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The test is whether or not the measure in question has general application, meaning it applies to objectively determined situations and entails legal effects for categories of persons regarded generally and in the abstract."}, {"question": "Can the participation of interested parties in the procedure leading to the adoption of a regulation lead to the conclusion that the measure constitutes an individual administrative measure?", "answer": "No, the distinction between a regulation and a decision may be based only on the nature of the measure itself and the legal effects it produces, and not on the procedures for its adoption."}, {"question": "Under what circumstances can an individual contest a regulation under the second paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty?", "answer": "An individual can contest a regulation if it is of direct and individual concern to them, but not if the regulation has general application within the meaning of Article 189 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "What is the consequence of a regulation being considered a measure of general application for an individual's ability to contest it?", "answer": "If a regulation is considered a measure of general application, an individual's application to contest it under the second paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty will be dismissed as inadmissible."}, {"question": "Do the procedural rules in Article 44(2) of Regulation No 1408/71 and Article 36(4) of Regulation No 574/72 change the conditions under which Member States grant invalidity benefits?", "answer": "The court rules that these provisions are of a procedural nature and entail no changes in the conditions to which Member States make the grant of invalidity benefits subject, which are determined by the legislation of each Member State."}, {"question": "Can a claimant waive an invalidity pension to receive an old-age pension that is more advantageous, according to the legislation of a Member State?", "answer": "The court states that it is for the legislation of each Member State to

account when a claimant is required to choose between two alternative benefits, for the purposes of calculations under Article 46 of Regulation No 1408/71?", "answer": "The court rules that the benefit to be taken into account is simply the benefit which the claimant elects to receive, pursuant to the first sentence of Article 44(2) of Regulation No 1408/71."}, {"question": "Do the second subparagraph of Article 46(1) of Regulation No 1408/71 and Article 36(4) of Regulation No 574/72 prevent an institution of a Member State from awarding an old-age pension instead of an invalidity pension that has been waived?", "answer": "The court rules that these provisions do not prevent an institution of a Member State from awarding a worker an old-age pension instead of an invalidity pension that has been waived in order to obtain an old-age pension that is more advantageous."}, {"question": "Is the loss of an invalidity benefit payable by the institution of a Member State under domestic law compatible with Community law when a claimant waives an invalidity pension to receive an old-age pension?", "answer": "The court implies that such a loss would be incompatible with Community law, citing its previous case-law that deprivation of a right acquired under national legislation alone would be incompatible with Article 51 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "What are the

investigation if that information indicates the existence of conduct contrary to the competition rules in the Treaty?", "answer": "Yes, the Commission is not barred from initiating an inquiry to verify or supplement information obtained during a previous investigation if that information indicates the existence of conduct contrary to the competition rules in the Treaty."}, {"question": "Is the fundamental right to the inviolability of the home recognized in the Community legal order as a principle common to the laws of the Member States in regard to business premises of undertakings?", "answer": "No, the fundamental right to the inviolability of the home is not recognized in the Community legal order as a principle common to the laws of the Member States in regard to business premises of undertakings, due to divergences between the legal systems of the Member States."}, {"question": "What protection is provided against arbitrary or disproportionate intervention by public authorities in the sphere of private activities of undertakings?", "answer": "The protection provided is that any intervention by the public authorities must have a legal basis and be justified on the grounds laid down by law, and the need for such protection is recognized as a general principle of Community law."}, {"question": "What are the conditions under which the national authorities will afford assistance to the Commission's officials during an investigation?", "answer": "The conditions under which the national authorities will afford assistance to the Commission's officials are

powers under Article 14 of Regulation No 17."}, {"question": "Can the validity of a decision be affected by acts subsequent to its adoption?", "answer": "No, the validity of a decision cannot be affected by acts subsequent to its adoption, and any irregularities committed in the implementation of the decision are irrelevant in assessing the validity thereof."}, {"question": "What is the

their previous experience."}, {"question": "Can Article 46 of the Staff Regulations, which deals with promotions, be applied to an employee who obtains their first definitive appointment within the Community administration after completing a probationary period?", "answer": "No, Article 46 is intended to govern the advancement of employees who already have the status of officials, and it is not adapted to the position of an employee who obtains their first definitive appointment after a period of service as a member of the temporary staff."}, {"question": "What discretion does the appointing authority have in assessing the previous experience of a person appointed as an official, and what factors can be taken into account?", "answer": "The appointing authority has a wide discretion in

post to be filled, within the limits laid down by the second paragraph of Article 32."}, {"question": "What is the consequence of the Commission's failure to consider the possibility of additional seniority under Article 32 when determining the applicant's step classification?", "answer": "The Commission's decisions must be annulled in so far as they concern the applicant's classification in step, as the Commission failed to consider the possibility of additional seniority under Article 32."}, {"question": "Can the Court declare that the applicant must be assigned to a specific step in their grade, or is this a matter for the appointing authority to decide?", "answer": "The Court cannot declare that the applicant must be assigned to a specific step in their grade, as this is a

authority."}, {"question": "Do explanatory notes to the nomenclature of the Customs Co-operation Council and opinions of the Committee on Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature have legally binding force?", "answer": "No, they do not have legally binding force, but may be considered as a valid aid to the interpretation of the tariff, and their content should be checked for accordance with the actual provisions of the Common Customs Tariff."}, {"question": "How should the expression 'breathing appliances (including gas masks and similar respirators)' in Tariff Heading 90.18 of the Common Customs Tariff be interpreted?", "answer": "The expression should be interpreted as including simple filter masks that cover only the mouth and nose, serve as protection against toxic chemical

regarded in terms of its normal base when it bears a properly issued registration plate, even if the authorization to use the vehicle has been withdrawn?", "answer": "The vehicle should be regarded as being normally based in the territory of the state in which it is registered, regardless of whether the authorization to use the vehicle has been withdrawn, and regardless of whether the withdrawal renders the registration invalid or entails its revocation."}, {"question": "Can a national bureau refuse to compensate a victim of an accident caused by a vehicle from another member state on the basis of specific exemptions from compulsory insurance provided for in national law?", "answer": "No, the national bureau of the state in which the accident occurred must treat the vehicle as being insured in respect of any accident that might occur, as long as insurance is compulsory for vehicles of that type in that state, and cannot reject a claim for compensation on the basis of specific exemptions from compulsory insurance."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the national bureau of the country in which the accident occurred and the guaranteeing body of the country in which the vehicle is normally based?", "answer": "The national bureau of the country in which the accident occurred guarantees the settlement of claims, and may seek reimbursement from the bureau of the member state in which the vehicle is registered.

obligation of a Member State regarding the refund of excess VAT under Article 18(4) of the Sixth Directive?", "answer": "The Member State must enable the taxable person to recover the entirety of the

Directive?", "answer": "No, the issue of Government bonds with a maturity period of 5 or 10 years is not a valid method of refunding excess VAT, as it does not provide the taxable person with liquid funds or equivalent means within a reasonable period of time, and may entail financial risk."}, {"question": "Can a Member State justify non-compliance with the Sixth Directive by citing difficulties in implementing the required changes or the limited number of taxable persons affected?", "answer": "No, a Member State cannot justify non-compliance with the Sixth Directive by citing difficulties in implementing the required changes or the limited number of taxable persons affected, as it is obligated to comply with the Directive regardless of such factors."}, {"question": "What is the fundamental principle underlying the common system of VAT, and how does it relate to the refund of excess VAT?", "answer": "The fundamental principle underlying the common system of VAT is the principle of neutrality, which ensures that all economic activities are taxed in a wholly neutral way, and the refund of excess VAT is one of the factors that ensures the application of this principle, by relieving the trader entirely of the burden of VAT payable or paid in the course of all their economic activities."}, {"question": "Does the European Court of Justice have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes related to compensation for damage caused by the Community institutions under Article 178 of the Treaty?", "answer": "Yes, the Court alone has jurisdiction, to the exclusion

83/515?", "answer": "The power of verification is intended solely to determine whether the schemes proposed by Member States satisfy the conditions for financial contributions from the Community, having regard to their compliance with the Directive and bearing in mind other structural measures already existing or envisaged for the fisheries sector."}, {"question": "Can a national scheme require the persons concerned to establish that the vessel will in future be used for purposes other than fishing, and is this at variance with the objectives of Directive 83/515?", "answer": "No, such a requirement is not at variance with the objectives of the Directive, as the aim of the Directive is to encourage reduction of production capacity by means of scrapping, definitive transfer of the vessel to a third country, or its assignment to purposes other than fishing."}, {"question": "Can the Commission incur non-contractual liability for damage suffered by an individual if the Commission approves a national scheme that does not satisfy the provisions of Directive 83/515?", "answer": "No, the Commission did not act unlawfully in approving the United Kingdom Scheme, as the Scheme did not impose an impossible evidential burden on the applicant, and the Minister had no discretion as to the grant of aid once the conditions laid down had been satisfied."}, {"question": "Is the Commission liable for the conduct of national authorities in the implementation of a Directive?", "answer": "No, the fact that the actual conduct of the national authorities may not be entirely free of blame cannot be attributed to the Commission in the exercise of its power of prior verification."}, {"question": "What are the conditions for the Community to incur liability for damage suffered by an individual?", "answer": "The Community may incur liability only if a series of conditions are met, including the illegality of the alleged conduct of the institutions, the reality of the damage, and the existence of a causal link between the conduct of the institution and the alleged damage."}, {"question": "Does the European Economic Community (EEC) Treaty allow for the removal of certain industries from the scope of competition rules, and if so, how is this done?", "answer": "The EEC Treaty allows for the removal of certain industries from the scope of competition rules through express derogation, as seen in Article 42 for the production and trade of agricultural products, but no such provision exists for the insurance industry."}, {"question": "Can the Commission apply competition rules to the insurance industry without restrictions or reservations?", "answer": "Yes, the Commission can apply competition rules to the insurance industry without restrictions or reservations, as the Treaty does not provide for any exceptions for this industry, and the Council has not adopted any special provisions to that effect."}, {"question": "Can a Member State's economic policy choices, such as those related to the supervision of insurance companies, limit the application of Community competition law?", "answer": "No, Community law does not make the implementation of competition rules dependent on the manner in which a Member State organizes the supervision of certain areas of economic activity, and the Commission can apply competition rules regardless of national economic policy choices."}, {"question": "What constitutes a \"decision\" of an association of undertakings within the meaning of Article 85(1) of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "A recommendation that accurately states the policy of an association of undertakings and is communicated to its members can be considered a \"decision\" of an association of undertakings, regardless of its legal status or whether it is described as \"non-binding\"."}, {"question": "Can an agreement or decision of an association of undertakings be considered restrictive of competition if it has the object of restricting competition, even if its effects are not examined?", "answer": "Yes, if it is apparent that an agreement or decision of an association of undertakings has the object of restricting competition, it is sufficient to establish a violation of Article 85(1), and it is not necessary to examine its effects."}, {"question": "Can a recommendation of an association of undertakings that increases premiums across-the-board be considered a restriction of competition?", "answer": "Yes, such a recommendation can be considered a restriction of competition, as it can lead to a collective fixed-rate increase in the price of services offered by the association's members, which is an example of anti-competitive conduct listed in Article 85(1)(a)."}, {"question": "Can trade between Member States be affected by a recommendation of an association of undertakings that applies only to the territory of one Member State?", "answer": "Yes, trade between Member States can be affected by such a recommendation, even if it only applies to one Member State, as it can make access to that market more difficult for foreign insurers and can have an impact on the financial relationship between a branch and its parent company."}, {"question": "What conditions must be met for an exemption from the prohibition contained in Article 85(1) to be granted under Article 85(3)?", "answer": "The Commission must determine whether the contested recommendation contributes to improving the provision of services on the insurance market, and whether the measures put into effect by the recommendation go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective."}, {"question": "Can the Commission's decision to refuse an exemption under Article 85(3) be challenged if it is based on a correct assessment of the recommendation's effects on competition?", "answer": "No, the Commission's decision to refuse an exemption under Article 85(3) cannot be challenged if it is based on a correct assessment of the recommendation's effects on competition, and the Court will not substitute its own assessment for that of the Commission."}, {"question": "Can the Court rule on the interpretation of national laws and regulations or on their conformity with Community law in proceedings under Article 177 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The Court may not rule on the interpretation of national laws and regulations or on their conformity with Community law; it may only provide the national court with the criteria for interpretation based on Community law."}, {"question": "Does Article 93(3) of the Treaty require that the notification to the Commission by a Member State of plans to grant or alter aid be immediately made known to all interested parties?", "answer": "Article 93(3) of the Treaty does not require that the notification to the Commission by a Member State of plans to grant or alter aid be immediately made known to all interested parties; such an obligation falls upon the Commission alone when it initiates the procedure provided for in Article 93(2)."}, {"question": "Does the obligation to inform the Commission of plans to grant aid, as imposed on Member States by the first sentence of Article 93(3), also apply to alterations made to such plans in the course of parliamentary debate?", "answer": "The obligation provided for in the first sentence of Article 93(3) to inform the Commission of plans to grant or alter aid does not apply solely to the initial plan, but also covers subsequent alterations to that plan; such information may be supplied to the Commission in the course of the consultations which take place following the initial notification."}, {"question": "Does the prohibition on the putting into effect of aid measures, as laid down in the last sentence of Article 93(3), apply to a plan for aid that has been duly notified in its initial version but subsequently altered without the Commission being informed of the alteration?", "answer": "The prohibition on the putting into effect of aid measures, which is laid down in the last sentence of Article 93(3), applies to the proposed aid programme in its entirety and in the final version adopted by the national authorities; if the plan initially notified has undergone alterations of which the Commission has not been informed, the prohibition applies to the plan as altered, unless the alteration in question is in actual fact a separate aid measure which should be assessed separately."}, {"question": "Does the duty to provide assistance under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations extend to retired staff?", "answer": "The court rules that the duty to provide assistance under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations has a more general scope and extends to retired staff, aiming to provide protection to officials and servants both at present and in the future."}, {"question": "Who is responsible for requesting assistance from the relevant institution under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations?", "answer": "In principle, it is for the person concerned to request assistance from the relevant institution, but exceptional circumstances may oblige the institution to provide specific assistance on its own initiative."}, {"question": "Can the Community institution be held liable for failing to inform its officials of changes in national legislation that may affect them?", "answer": "The court rules that the Community institution has a duty to inform its officials, including retired staff, of changes in national legislation that may affect them, especially when the institution is aware of the individual's situation."}, {"question": "How should the Community institution balance its duty to provide assistance with the need to respect the autonomy of its officials?", "answer": "The court states that the institution should provide assistance when an official has a need for it, but also considers that the official has a responsibility to inform the institution of their situation and to take steps to protect their own interests."}, {"question": "Can the Community institution be held liable for damages resulting from its failure to provide adequate assistance to its officials?", "answer": "The court rules that the institution can be held liable for damages resulting from its failure to provide adequate assistance, but the amount of damages should take into account the official's own conduct and any advantages they may have derived from the situation."}, {"question": "How should the court determine the amount of damages to be paid to an official who has suffered loss due to the institution's failure to provide adequate assistance?", "answer": "The court rules that the amount of damages should be determined by considering the official's loss, the institution's degree of fault, and any advantages the official may have derived from the situation, and may order the institution to pay a proportion of the official's costs."}, {"question": "Does Regulation No 1164/89 lay down any limit on the sown areas eligible for aid for fibre flax and hemp?", "answer": "No, neither the second indent of Article 2 of Regulation No 1164/89 nor any other provisions of that regulation lays down any limit on the sown areas eligible for the aid in question."}, {"question": "Can a Member State grant aid for trial sowings over unlimited areas under Regulation No 1164/89?", "answer": "Although Regulation No 1164/89 provides no basis for aid to be granted for trial sowings over unlimited areas, the Member State under whose supervision the aid is managed has to ensure that there is no abuse and that the sowings are carried out within reasonable limits in relation to the examination envisaged."}, {"question": "Is the Commission entitled to limit the aid in question to a maximum area of 100 hectares without express provision in Regulation No 1164/89?", "answer": "No, the Commission is not entitled to limit the aid in question to a maximum area of 100 hectares without express provision in Regulation No 1164/89, as such a limitation would be a retroactive and unilateral decision that infringes the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations."}, {"question": "Can the Commission use Directive 72/180 to limit the trial areas for aid granted for fibre flax and hemp?", "answer": "No, Directive 72/180, which concerns determination of the characteristics and minimum conditions for examining varieties capable of being included in the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species, has no connection with aid granted for trial plantings and contains no provision concerning a limitation of such plantings."}, {"question": "Is the obligation to process the harvest inherent in Article 2 of Regulation No 1164/89 for aid to be granted?", "answer": "No, the obligation to process the harvest is not inherent in Article 2 of Regulation No 1164/89, as the aid is granted for the areas sown and not for the processing of the harvest, which generally does not take place until several years later."}, {"question": "Can the Commission take a decision to limit aid by way of administrative action without going through the procedures laid down in Article 12 of Regulation No 1308/70?", "answer": "No, the Commission cannot take a decision to limit aid by way of administrative action without going through the procedures laid down in Article 12 of Regulation No 1308/70, as such a decision would be a legislative measure that requires consultation of the Management Committee for Flax and Hemp."}, {"question": "Does Article 226 of the EEC Treaty allow the Commission to authorize a Member State to impose protective measures without an explicit application from that state?", "answer": "The court rules that while Article 226(1) provides that the state concerned should apply for authorization, the Commission has the power to fix protective measures and subject them to conditions, including the condition that the state does not itself prefer to apply them."}, {"question": "Can the Commission's authorization to a Member State to impose protective measures be made subject to the condition that the exporting Member State does not itself impose the duty?", "answer": "The court rules that the authorization granted to the state applying to take protective measures may be made subject to the condition that the state, a sector of whose economic activity is affected by these measures, does not itself prefer to apply them."}, {"question": "Do difficulties arising exclusively from the application of the mandatory provisions of the Treaty, such as the elimination of internal tariffs, constitute difficulties within the meaning of Article 226?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 226 employs the term 'difficulties' without making any distinction on the basis of whether the difficulties were caused by the application of the Treaty or otherwise."}, {"question": "Can the Commission's decision to authorize protective measures be considered invalid due to the failure to state reasons or because the Commission had recourse to Article 226 to avoid the application of Article 235?", "answer": "The court rules that the lawful exercise of the powers conferred by the Treaty cannot constitute an infringement of Article 235, and that the Commission's decision contains no defect that can be removed by action taken by the Commission of its own motion."}, {"question": "Is the Commission required to publish its decisions authorizing protective measures, and can the failure to do so affect the validity of the decision?", "answer": "The court rules that while it is desirable to bring such decisions to the attention of the public, Article 191 only requires that decisions be notified to those to whom they are addressed, and that the 'clearly stipulated' exception was constituted by Article 226 itself."}, {"question": "Does the Commission's authorization to a Member State to impose protective measures confer the power to introduce a duty on the export of products to another Member State?", "answer": "The court rules that the decisions of the EEC Commission fixing the protective measures applicable to the importation into the Federal Republic of Germany of bread and fondant paste originating in other Member States confer upon the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the power to introduce a duty of the same amount on the export of those products to the Federal Republic of Germany."}, {"question": "Can a regulation laying down detailed arrangements for the grant of community aid in a member state be considered a measure of direct and individual concern to a business established in that member state which is eligible for the aid in question?", "answer": "No, such a regulation is a measure of general application which applies to objectively determined situations and entails legal effects for a category of persons considered generally and in the abstract, and therefore cannot be of direct and individual concern."}, {"question": "What form must an allegation that an institution is in breach of its obligations under Article 176 of the Treaty take after the annulment of one of its measures?", "answer": "The allegation must take the form of an action for failure to act, where it is not alleged that the measure adopted to replace the annulled measure is illegal, but the question is raised whether the institution must take other action relating to other measures which were not challenged in the proceedings for annulment."}, {"question": "What is required of an institution in order to comply with a judgment annulling one of its measures and to implement it fully?", "answer": "The institution is required to have regard not only to the operative part of the judgment but also to the grounds which led to the judgment and constitute its essential basis, in so far as they are necessary to determine the exact meaning of what is stated in the operative part."}, {"question": "Can a finding of illegality in the grounds of a judgment annulling a measure give rise to consequences for the institution beyond the elimination of the illegality in the measure intended to replace the annulled measure?", "answer": "Yes, a finding of illegality may also give rise to other consequences for the institution, particularly in cases where the effect of the annulled regulation is limited to a clearly defined period."}, {"question": "What is the obligation of an institution when a judgment annulling one of its measures has retroactive effect?", "answer": "The institution is under an obligation to eliminate from legislation already adopted and governing periods subsequent to the annulled measure any provisions with the same effect as the provisions held to be illegal, and to ensure that new legislation adopted after the judgment contains no provisions having the same effect as the provisions held to be illegal."}, {"question": "Can an individual or a company bring an action for the annulment of a legislative measure or for a declaration that a Community institution has failed to act after being called upon to adopt such a measure?", "answer": "No, individuals or companies have no standing to challenge the legality of a legislative measure or to bring an action for the annulment of such a measure or for a declaration that a Community institution has failed to act after being called upon to adopt such a measure, unless the measure is of direct and individual concern to them."}, {"question": "What is the remedy provided by the Treaty for obtaining a finding that the Commission is under an obligation to act in a particular way after a judgment annulling one of its measures?", "answer": "The remedy provided by the Treaty is an action under Article 175, which allows a member state or an institution to bring an action for a declaration that the Commission has failed to act in accordance with the Treaty."}, {"question": "Are protective measures against a debtor's property, taken under Article 39 of the Convention, subject to the procedural rules of municipal law, or is there a single legal instrument applicable in all contracting states?", "answer": "The Convention leaves the matter of resolving any question not covered by specific provisions of the treaty to the procedural law of the court hearing the proceedings, but the application of national procedural law must not lead to frustration of the principles laid down by the Convention."}, {"question": "Is authorization required from the court to enable protective measures to be taken against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought, or may the applicant proceed directly with the protective measures without specific authorization?", "answer": "By virtue of Article 39 of the Convention, a party who has applied for and obtained authorization for enforcement may proceed directly with protective measures against the property of the party against whom enforcement is sought and is under no obligation to obtain specific authorization."}, {"question": "Are protective measures taken under Article 39 subject to the rule that they must be taken within a non-extendable period running from the date on which the party applying for those measures is in a position to proceed with them?", "answer": "A party who has obtained authorization for enforcement may proceed with the protective measures referred to in Article 39 until the expiry of the period for lodging an appeal prescribed in Article 36 and, if such an appeal is lodged, until a decision is given thereon."}, {"question": "Is a party who has proceeded with protective measures under Article 39 required to obtain a confirmatory judgment in respect of those measures, as required by national law?", "answer": "A party who has proceeded with the protective measures referred to in Article 39 of the Convention is under no obligation to obtain, in respect of those measures, any confirmatory judgment required by the national law of the court in question."}, {"question": "Can the party against whom protective measures have been applied take legal proceedings to secure adequate protection of their rights, which they allege have been infringed by the measures in question?", "answer": "Article 39 does not prevent the party against whom those measures have been applied from taking legal proceedings in order to secure, by recourse to the appropriate procedures laid down in the national law of the court dealing with the matter, adequate protection of the rights which they allege to have been infringed by the measures in question."}, {"question": "Is the additional amount under Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3429/80 levied only on imports in excess of the quantities for which an import licence has been issued, or also in cases where the import licence accompanying the goods is not valid?", "answer": "The court rules that the additional amount must also be levied in cases where preserved mushrooms have been released into free circulation in the Community and it has been discovered, after their release into free circulation, that they were not accompanied by a valid import licence."}, {"question": "Is the level of the additional amount fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3429/80 lawful in light of the principle of proportionality?", "answer": "The court rules that the level of the additional amount fixed by the regulation is not lawful, as it is disproportionate to the objective pursued by the Commission, and the Commission could have fixed different additional amounts according to the quality of the goods and the circumstances in which they were imported, as authorized by Article 2(2) of Regulation No 521/77."}, {"question": "Can the Commission fix a single, fixed rate for the additional amount without taking into account the origin or quality of the mushrooms?", "answer": "The court rules that while a fixed rate is not inherently unlawful, the introduction of a single, fixed rate that is applied to all preserved mushrooms irrespective of their origin or grade can lead to a disproportionate penalty being imposed on importers of lower-grade mushrooms, and the Commission should have taken into account the origin and quality of the mushrooms when fixing the additional amount."}, {"question": "What is the objective of the additional amount introduced by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3429/80?", "answer": "The court rules that the objective of the additional amount is to protect the Community market in mushrooms from serious disturbances on account of imports from non-member countries, and not to exclude completely imports in excess of certain quantities or to penalize imports without a licence."}, {"question": "Can a State acceding to the European Union adopt legislation introducing a levy on sugar stocks held within that State on the eve of its accession?", "answer": "The court rules that Articles 137(2) and 145(2) of the Act of Accession, Articles 39 and 40 of the Treaty, Regulation No 1785/81, and Regulation No 3300/94 do not preclude a State acceding to the European Union from adopting such legislation."}, {"question": "Does the adoption of a national levy on sugar stocks, such as the Lageravgiftslag, constitute an unlawful interference in the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector?", "answer": "The court states that such a levy does not interfere with the functioning of the mechanisms for the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector, as long as it does not affect the situation of agricultural products in stock on the date of accession in a way that contradicts Community law."}, {"question": "Can a national measure, like the Lageravgiftslag, be considered compatible with the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector if it aims to prevent the accumulation of excessive stock?", "answer": "The court rules that a national measure like the Lageravgiftslag can be compatible with the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector if it is designed to avoid excessive stocks and does not run counter to the objectives of the common agricultural policy or impede the functioning of the mechanisms used to attain those objectives."}, {"question": "Does the principle of good faith, as laid down in Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, preclude a State from adopting legislation like the Lageravgiftslag after the Act of Accession has been signed?", "answer": "The court does not address this argument as it finds that the Lageravgiftslag does not interfere with the functioning of the mechanisms for the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector, rendering the discussion on the principle of good faith unnecessary in this context."}, {"question": "Can a Member State justify a failure to comply with EU directives by citing provisions, practices, or circumstances within its internal legal system?", "answer": "The court rules that a Member State may not plead provisions, practices, or circumstances existing in its internal legal system to justify a failure to comply with obligations and time-limits laid down in Community directives."}, {"question": "What is the consequence for a Member State that fails to notify the measures taken to implement EU directives within the specified time limit?", "answer": "The court holds that failure to notify the measures adopted for the implementation of EU directives within the specified time limit constitutes a failure to fulfil obligations under the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Is a Member State required to adopt measures to implement EU directives even if it lacks the necessary financial means?", "answer": "The court implies that a lack of financial means does not justify a failure to implement EU directives, as a Member State may not plead circumstances existing in its internal legal system to justify non-compliance."}, {"question": "Can a Member State be held accountable for failing to adopt specific measures required by an EU directive, such as a systematic plan of action or a timetable for improvement?", "answer": "The court rules that a Member State's failure to adopt specific measures required by an EU directive, such as a systematic plan of action or a timetable for improvement, constitutes a failure to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs when a Member State is found to have failed to fulfil its obligations under the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court orders the unsuccessful party, in this case, the Kingdom of Belgium, to pay the costs."}, {"question": "Does the principle of

qualifications acquired as evidenced by a diploma issued in that other Member State."}, {"question": "Is a Member State allowed to subject access to certain occupations by nationals of other Member States to a condition of reciprocity?", "answer": "No, a Member State which subjects access to certain occupations by nationals of other Member States to a condition of reciprocity fails to fulfil its obligations under Articles 48, 52, and 59 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "How should the equivalence of a diploma obtained in another Member State be assessed?", "answer": "The equivalence of a diploma obtained in another Member State must be assessed with sole regard to the degree of knowledge and qualifications which that diploma, taking into account the nature and duration of the studies and practical training certified to have been completed, allows to be presumed on the part of the holder."}, {"question": "Can a Member State escape its obligation to adapt its national legislation to the requirements of the Treaty by relying on administrative or judicial practice, or by claiming that nationals of other Member States will receive the same treatment in the future?", "answer": "No, a Member State cannot escape its obligation to adapt its national legislation to the requirements of the Treaty by relying on a certain administrative or judicial practice, or by claiming that the nationals of the other Member States will in future receive the same treatment as its own nationals, as this maintains a state of uncertainty and ambiguity for the persons concerned."}, {"question": "Can national legislation that restricts or prohibits certain forms of advertising and sales promotion be considered an obstacle to the free movement of goods, even if it does not directly affect trade?", "answer": "Yes, such legislation may restrict the volume of trade by affecting marketing opportunities, and thus must be examined in the light of Articles 30, 31, and 36 of the EEC Treaty."},

particularly in frontier areas, where consumers resident in one Member State may travel freely to the territory of another Member State to shop under the same conditions as the local population."}, {"question": "Can a prohibition on distributing advertising be justified if it deprives consumers of access to information available in the country where purchases are made?", "answer": "No, such a prohibition compromises the freedom of consumers to shop under the same conditions as the local population and must be examined in the light of Articles 30, 31, and 36 of the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Can national legislation that prevents consumers from having access to certain information be justified in the interest of consumer protection?", "answer": "No, under Community law, the provision of information to the consumer is considered one of the principal requirements for consumer protection, and Article 30 cannot be interpreted as meaning that national legislation which denies the consumer access to certain kinds of information may be justified by mandatory requirements concerning consumer protection."}, {"question": "Can obstacles to intra-Community trade resulting from national rules on advertising be justified by reasons relating to consumer protection?", "answer": "No, such obstacles fall under the prohibition laid down in Article 30 of the Treaty, and the exceptions to the application of that provision contained in Article 36 are not applicable."}, {"question": "Can advertising lawfully distributed in another Member State be made subject to national legislation prohibiting the inclusion of certain information, such as the duration of a special offer or the previous price?", "answer": "No, under Articles 30 and 36 of the EEC Treaty, properly

pregnancy and maternity, even if these provisions may seem to contradict the principle of equal treatment?", "answer": "The court rules that Directive 76/207 recognizes the legitimacy of protecting a woman's needs in two respects: ensuring the protection of her biological condition during pregnancy and protecting the special relationship between a woman and her child after childbirth."}, {"question": "Can maternity leave granted to a woman after the expiry of the statutory protective period be reserved exclusively for the mother, or must it be made available to fathers as well?", "answer": "The court rules that such leave may legitimately be reserved to the mother, as it is only the mother who may find herself subject to undesirable pressures to return to work prematurely."}, {"question": "Do Member States have discretion in adopting social measures to guarantee the protection of women in connection with pregnancy and maternity, and to offset the disadvantages women suffer with regard to the retention of employment?", "answer": "The court rules that Member States enjoy a reasonable margin of discretion as regards both the nature of the protective measures and the detailed arrangements for their implementation, as these measures are closely linked to the general system of social protection in each Member State."}, {"question": "Does Directive 76/207 impose a requirement on Member States to allow fathers to take maternity leave as an alternative to mothers, even if the parents so decide?", "answer": "The court rules that Directive 76/207 does not impose such a requirement on Member States, and that they may grant maternity leave to mothers without being obliged to offer it to fathers as an alternative."}, {"question": "Can a Member State grant a period of maternity leave to mothers after the statutory protective period has expired, and encourage them to take it by paying an allowance?", "answer": "The court rules that Articles 1, 2, and 5(1)

alternative."}, {"question": "Can a transfer of shares from a member with unlimited liability to a member with limited liability be subject to capital duty under Article 4 of Directive 69/335?", "answer": "The court rules that such a transfer cannot be subject to capital duty under Article 4 of the directive, as it does not involve an increase in the capital of a capital company or an increase in the assets of a capital company."}, {"question": "Can a transfer of shares from a member with unlimited liability to a member with limited liability be subject to capital duty under Article 6 of Directive 69/335 in Member States that have elected to exempt contributions subscribed by members with unlimited liability?", "answer": "The court rules that such a transfer cannot be subject to capital duty under Article 6 of the directive in Member States that have elected to exempt contributions subscribed by members with unlimited liability, where the shares transferred have already been subjected to capital tax at the time of their creation."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Article 6 of Directive 69/335 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital?", "answer": "The purpose of Article 6 is to prevent a situation in which shares that have not been taxed because they constituted the contribution of a member with unlimited liability are later transferred to a member with limited liability and are thus converted into limited partner shares without being subjected to the capital duty which their issue should have attracted."}, {"question": "Does the Directive 69/335 allow Member States to subject to capital duty the conversion of part of a general partner share into a limited partner share within a pre-existing company?", "answer": "The court rules that the Directive does not allow Member States to subject to capital duty the conversion of part of a general partner share into a limited partner share within a pre-existing company, as this type of transaction is not listed in Article 4 of the directive."}, {"question": "What is the primary purpose of Article 34(2) of the Staff Regulations, which requires a report to be made on a probationary official at least one month before the expiry of their probationary period?", "answer": "The primary purpose is to ensure that the decision whether or not to establish the probationary official can be made before the expiry of their probationary period."}, {"question": "Can a delay in drawing up a probationary report affect a probationary official adversely if the decision not to

remain in their post and are paid during that period."}, {"question": "Is it a misuse of procedure if a probationary report is supplemented by fresh comments made by superiors after a complaint has been submitted by the probationary official?", "answer": "No, it is not a misuse of procedure if a probationary report is supplemented by fresh comments made by superiors after a complaint has been submitted, as long as the probationary official's right to a hearing is respected at every stage of the procedure."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the probationary period in the context of recruitment and establishment of officials?", "answer": "The purpose of the probationary period is to enable the administration to make a more concrete assessment of the candidate's suitability for a particular post, the manner in which they perform their duties, and their efficiency in the service."}, {"question": "How does the decision not to establish a probationary official differ from dismissal in the strict sense of a person who has been appointed an established official?", "answer": "The decision not to establish a probationary official differs from dismissal in that it involves a comprehensive assessment of the qualities and conduct of the probationary official, taking into account both positive and negative factors, whereas dismissal requires a detailed examination of the grounds justifying the termination of employment."}, {"question": "What criteria should be used to assess the decision not to establish a probationary official?", "answer": "The decision not to establish a probationary official should be assessed based on whether there are positive considerations showing that establishment of the probationary official is in the interests of the service,

the Member State to comment before a definitive decision to reduce assistance is adopted constitutes an essential procedural requirement."}, {"question": "What are the consequences of disregarding the essential procedural requirement of allowing the Member State to comment before reducing financial assistance?", "answer": "The disregard of this essential procedural requirement renders the contested decisions void."}, {"question": "Can the Commission's argument that the Member State can enter into a dialogue with the Fund after the decisions reducing assistance have been notified be accepted?", "answer": "No, this argument cannot be accepted, as it would bar the recipient of the assistance and the Member State from bringing an action for annulment against the decisions reducing the assistance after the expiry of the period allowed by the Treaty."}, {"question": "What is the outcome of the case, given the infringement of the essential procedural requirement?", "answer": "The contested decisions reducing the assistance must be annulled, without the need to examine the other pleas in law put forward by the applicant."}, {"question": "Who is responsible for paying the costs,

{"question": "What is the nature of the financial arrangements referred to in Article 53 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The financial arrangements referred to in Article 53 are arrangements based on the

observe the other articles of the Treaty, particularly Articles 2, 4, and 5, when exercising its powers under Article 53?", "answer": "Yes, the express reference to Article 3 in Article 53 does not release the High Authority from its duty to observe the other articles of the Treaty, particularly Articles 2, 4, and 5, which establish the fundamental objectives of the Community."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority impose measures that involve different treatment of undertakings if the circumstances so require?", "answer": "Yes, the protection of the common interest does not rule out the inclusion of measures combining the pursuit of various objectives laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty, including measures of a selective or gradual nature, if they are compatible with the principle of equality and necessary to carry out the tasks laid down in Article 3."}, {"question": "What is the relationship between the indirect means of action prescribed in Article 57 and the direct influence referred to in Article 5?", "answer": "The indirect means of action prescribed in Article 57 and the direct influence referred to in Article 5 are distinct, with indirect means creating conditions that encourage undertakings to choose the desired behavior, while direct influence prescribes behavior on pain of fines."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority's financial arrangements under Article 53 be considered equivalent to a system of allocation under Article 59?", "answer": "No, the financial arrangements under Article 53 do not constitute a system of allocation, as they are intended to encourage economization of ferrous scrap and ensure a regular supply to the market, rather than allocating resources."}, {"question": "Is the High Authority's imposition of higher contributions on certain undertakings than on others under Article 53 considered a special charge prohibited by Article 4(c)?", "answer": "No, the unequal allocation of charges based on objectively established criteria justified by the objectives pursued under the arrangement is not considered a special charge within the meaning of Article 4(c)."}, {"question": "Can the High Authority's measures under Article 53 be more restrictive than necessary for the purpose of the financial arrangement?", "answer": "No, the measures must not be more restrictive than necessary for the purpose of the financial arrangement, and the Court has found that the measures in question were justified by the economic circumstances and the need to encourage economization of ferrous scrap."}, {"question": "Can several companies belonging to one group participate in a tender procedure at the same time?", "answer": "Yes, the rule that tenders must be independent does not prevent several companies belonging to one group from taking part at the same time in one tender procedure, but it does preclude those same companies from agreeing on the terms and conditions of the tenders which they each submit."}, {"question": "What is the obligation of Member States in ensuring the implementation of Community decisions on agricultural intervention financed by the EAGGF?", "answer": "Member States must take the measures necessary to satisfy themselves that the transactions financed by the EAGGF are actually carried out and are executed correctly, and to prevent and deal with irregularities and recover sums

be attributed to it."}, {"question": "Is the Commission required to provide detailed reasons for its decision concerning the clearance of accounts?", "answer": "No, the extent of the obligation to state reasons depends on the nature of the measure in question and on the context in which it was adopted, and decisions concerning the clearance of accounts do not require detailed reasons if the government concerned was closely involved in the process by which the decision came about."}, {"question": "Can the Commission apply a correction to the expenditure declared by a Member State if it finds that the Member State has infringed Community rules?", "answer": "Yes, if the Commission has established that a Member State has infringed several Community rules and that harm was probably

financial consequences to be attributed to it."}, {"question": "Does Article 8 of Directive 64/221 require Member States to provide the same legal remedies to nationals of other Member States as are available to their own nationals in respect of decisions concerning entry, residence permits, or expulsion, where the national legislation provides different remedies for acts of the administration generally and decisions concerning entry by nationals of the Member State?", "answer": "The court rules that the obligation imposed by Article 8 is satisfied if nationals of other Member States enjoy the same remedies as those available against acts of the administration generally in that Member State."}, {"question": "Do the three cases mentioned in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/221, namely where there is no right of appeal to a court of law, or where such appeal may be only in respect of the legal validity of the decision, or where the appeal cannot have suspensory effect, apply equally to Article 9(2), which concerns refusals to issue a first residence permit or decisions ordering expulsion before the issue of such a permit?", "answer": "The court rules that the three cases mentioned in Article 9(1) apply equally to Article 9(2), meaning that the addressee of a decision refusing to issue a first residence permit or a decision ordering expulsion before the issue of such a permit is entitled to obtain an opinion from the competent authority in the same circumstances as those defined in Article 9(1)."}, {"question": "Does a national of a Member State who has been refused entry into another Member State on grounds of public order or public security have a right of appeal under Article 8 of Directive 64/221 and, if appropriate, a right to obtain the opinion of an independent

prohibiting entry?", "answer": "The court rules that a national of a Member State against whom an initial decision refusing entry into another Member State has been made on grounds of public order or

decision taken by the administrative authorities on an application made after a reasonable time has elapsed since the last decision prohibiting entry."}, {"question": "How should air filters be classified under the Common Customs Tariff, considering their primary function and components?", "answer": "The court rules that air filters should be classified as articles of textile material of a kind commonly used in machinery or plant under Heading No 59.17, or as machinery and appliances and parts thereof, of glass, under Heading No 70.20, according to whether the filtering component consists of textile material or of glass fibre."}, {"question": "Do the additional components, such as bonding agents or adhesives and covering materials, affect the classification of air filters as articles of textile material or glass fibre?", "answer": "The court determines that these additional components, despite their weight and value, are accessories to the essential filtering component and do not deprive the filters of their character as articles of textile material or glass fibre."}, {"question": "What is the essential character of air filters that determines their classification under the Common Customs Tariff?", "answer": "The court finds that the essential character of air filters derives from their filtering capacity, and the component that is indispensable for this process is the textile material or glass fibre."}, {"question": "Can air filters be classified under a heading that provides a more general description, such as Heading No 84.18, which covers machinery and apparatus for filtering or purifying liquids or gases?", "answer": "The court rules that, due to specific rules in the Common Customs Tariff, air filters must be classified under the more specific headings (59.17 or 70.20) according to their filtering component, rather than under a more general heading like 84.18."}, {"question": "Is a Member State's intervention in the

market at a price lower than the target price without violating the Common Organization of the Market in cereals?", "answer": "The court states that such action is incompatible with the Common Organization of the Market in cereals, as it jeopardizes the objective of guaranteeing producers a price based on the target price."}, {"question": "Under Community rules, what price can an individual producer of cereals claim to obtain?", "answer": "The court rules that an individual producer may claim that they should not be prevented from obtaining a price approximating to the target price and

court states that an individual producer cannot claim to have suffered damage if they have sold their products above the target price, as they have obtained the advantages intended to be produced by the regulation."}, {"question": "What are the consequences for a Member State if its intervention in the market causes damage to an individual producer in violation of Community law?", "answer": "The court rules that if an individual producer has suffered damage as a result of a Member State's intervention in violation of Community law, the State is liable to the injured party and must take the consequences upon itself in the context of national law relating to the liability of the State."}, {"question": "Can a Member State justify non-compliance with EU directives by citing provisions,

within the Community."}, {"question": "Can a national court decide on the discriminatory effect of a regulation and reduce the amount of the charge accordingly?", "answer": "The court rules that it is not necessary to consider this question, as the plaintiff has not shown what constitutes the discrimination alleged to result from the provisions at issue."}, {"question": "Does the failure to apply a corrective amount to whole-milk powder cause distortions of competition in the milk market?", "answer": "The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim, and that the statistics supplied by the Commission show that production of whole-milk powder declined sharply in Germany at the time in question, despite the non-application of the corrective amount."}, {"question": "Is the substitution of skimmed-milk powder supplemented by butter-fat for whole-milk powder a result of the provisions at issue, and does it constitute discrimination between

EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that consideration of the questions raised has disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Regulation No 725/74, having regard to the provisions of Article 40(3) of the EEC Treaty."}, {"question": "Can a Member State impose a minimum fat content requirement on cheeses imported from other Member States where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed?", "answer": "No, Article 30 of the Treaty and Article 22(1) of Regulation No 804/68 preclude a Member State from making the importation and marketing of cheeses conditional upon compliance with a minimum fat content."}, {"question": "Can a Member State restrict the use of a generic name, such as \"cheese\", for imported products that do not meet the minimum fat content requirement of the importing Member State?", "answer": "No, the Court rules that it would be incompatible with Article 30 of the Treaty to apply such rules to imported cheeses that have been lawfully produced and marketed in another Member State under the same generic name but with a lower fat content."}, {"question": "Can the absence of Community rules on the production, marketing, and designation of cheeses justify a Member State's rules that hinder intra-Community trade?", "answer": "No, the Court rejects this argument, stating that the application of the principle of the free movement of goods would not give rise to serious confusion to the detriment of consumers if adequate labelling is provided."}, {"question": "What measures can a Member State take to ensure consumer protection and fair trading in the absence of common or harmonized rules on the manufacture and marketing of cheese?", "answer": "The Court rules that it would be sufficient for the Member State to prescribe adequate labelling to provide correct information on the actual fat content of cheeses, enabling consumers to make their choice in full knowledge of the facts."}, {"question": "Can rules hindering intra-Community trade be justified if they are necessary to satisfy mandatory requirements relating to consumer protection and fair trading?", "answer": "Yes, but only if the rules are necessary and proportional to the objective pursued; in this case, the Court finds that adequate labelling would be sufficient to ensure consumer protection and fair trading, making the Italian Republic's rules unjustified."}, {"question": "Can the Commission alter the subject-matter of tariff headings defined by the Harmonised System (HS) established by the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System?", "answer": "The Commission's power to adopt measures under Article 9 of Regulation No 2658/87 does not authorise it to alter the subject-matter of

inherent to the product and can be assessed on the basis of the product's objective characteristics and properties."}, {"question": "Does the term \"builders' carpentry\" in CN heading 4418 include all products made of glue-laminated timber?", "answer": "Although certain products made of glue-laminated timber are covered by the designation \"builders' carpentry\" in CN heading 4418, not all products made of glue-laminated timber must be classified under that heading; they must have the objective characteristics and properties defined by the wording of CN heading 4418."}, {"question": "Is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1509/97 valid in classifying rectangular wood blocks under CN subheading 4418 90 10?", "answer": "The Commission Regulation (EC) No 1509/97 is invalid in so far as it

slightly rounded edges, under CN subheading 4418 90 10, as it altered the subject-matter of CN heading 4418."}, {"question": "What is the correct classification for the rectangular wood blocks at issue in the main proceedings?", "answer": "The correct classification for the rectangular wood blocks is a matter for the national court to determine, but the Court suggests that CN subheading 4421 90 99 may be a possible classification, as the blocks do not meet the requirements for classification under CN heading 4418."}, {"question": "What is the extent of the obligation to state the reasons on which a measure is based, as laid down in Article 190 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The extent of the obligation to state the reasons on which a measure is based depends on the nature of the measure

EAGGF?", "answer": "No, a detailed statement of reasons is not required for a decision on clearance of accounts in respect of expenditure financed by the EAGGF, as the government concerned was closely

when a regulation lays down specific measures of supervision, Member States must apply them, and it is unnecessary to examine the merits of their view that another system of supervision is more effective."}, {"question": "What is the consequence of not complying with the requirements for export declarations, such as lodging the declaration after the goods have left the customs territory?", "answer": "Non-compliance with the requirements for export declarations, such as lodging the declaration after the goods have left the customs territory, may result in the refusal of export refunds."}, {"question": "How should the costs be allocated when an action is dismissed, and the parties have reached an agreement on part of the application?", "answer": "The unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs, including the costs related to the part of the application that was settled by agreement, if the agreement was reached after the additional review authorized by the Commission."}, {"question": "Must insurance periods completed in a territory that was previously subject to the legislation of a Member State, but has since gained independence, be taken into consideration when calculating pensions under Regulation No 3, even if the claim for the pension is made after the date of independence?", "answer": "The court rules that, in so far as is necessary for the acquisition, maintenance, or recovery of the right to benefits, insurance periods completed in such a territory before the date of independence must be taken into consideration in calculating the pensions referred to in Chapters 2 and 3 of Regulation No 3, even if the risk materializes and the claim for a pension is made after that date."}, {"question": "Does the principle of equality of treatment provided for by Article 8 of Regulation No 3 mean that national laws of a Member State, which stipulate the taking into account and adjustment of accrued rights and social security benefits in respect of insurance periods completed in a part of that state which has become independent, also apply to nationals of another Member State who are resident in the territory of another Member State?", "answer": "The court does not provide a direct answer to this question, as it is deemed superfluous in view of the answer given to the first question."}, {"question": "Can a Member State alter a pre-existing designation of origin after the entry into force of Regulation No 2081/92?", "answer": "The court rules that a Member State may not, by adopting provisions of national law, alter a designation of origin for which it has requested registration in accordance with Article 17 and protect that designation at national level."}, {"question": "Does the absence of a footnote in the annex to Regulation No 1107/96 specifying that registration is not sought for one of the parts of a compound designation of origin mean that each of its constituent parts is protected?", "answer": "The court rules that the absence of a footnote does not necessarily mean that each of its constituent parts is protected, as questions concerning the protection of constituent parts are matters for the national court to determine on a case-by-case basis."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the system of footnotes in the annex to Regulation No 1107/96?", "answer": "The court rules that there is nothing in the regulation to suggest that the use of the system of footnotes has the purpose of indicating that all constituent parts of a compound designation of origin are protected in the absence of a footnote."}, {"question": "Can a Member State maintain national protection of a designation of origin pending registration at the Community level?", "answer": "The court rules that a Member State may maintain national protection of a designation of origin until a decision on registration has been taken, but this does not imply that the Member State can alter the designation of origin without following the procedures established by the regulation."}, {"question": "What is the scope of protection afforded by Article 13 of Regulation No 2081/92 to compound designations of origin?", "answer": "The court rules that Article 13 does not constitute a sufficient basis for interpreting the 1996 regulation as meaning that, in the absence of a footnote, each constituent part of a compound name is protected, and that questions concerning the protection of constituent parts are matters for the national court to determine on a case-by-case basis."}, {"question": "What constitutes \"labelling\" within the meaning of Article 1(3)(a) of Directive 79/112 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer?", "answer": "Labelling within the meaning of Article 1(3)(a) of Directive 79/112 must be construed as words, particulars and other information relating to a foodstuff which are specifically intended to inform the consumer as to the characteristics of the product in question."}, {"question": "Does a national cheese mark that includes particulars of the country of production, type of cheese, one or two letters varying according to the region of production, a serial number, and a combination of letters or numbers constitute labelling within the meaning of Directive 79/112?", "answer": "No, such a national cheese mark does not constitute labelling within the meaning of Directive 79/112, as its primary purpose is to enable the public authorities to verify that the cheese was produced in accordance with the relevant rules, rather than to inform the consumer about the characteristics of the product."}, {"question": "Is a national measure requiring cheese producers to affix a cheese mark with regional indicators compatible with the provisions of Directive 79/112, particularly Article 15, when there are no appreciable regional differences in quality?", "answer": "The directive does not apply to such a national measure, as the cheese mark in question does not constitute labelling within the meaning of Article 1(3)(a) of Directive 79/112, and therefore does not fall within its scope."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Directive 79/112, and how does it relate to the concept of labelling?", "answer": "The purpose of Directive 79/112 is to inform and protect the ultimate consumer of foodstuffs, and labelling is a key aspect of this, as it is intended to provide the consumer with information about the characteristics of the product, such as its nature, identity, properties, composition, quantity, durability, origin, and method of manufacture or production."}, {"question": "Do Community institutions have the discretion to organize their departments and assign staff as they see fit?", "answer": "The court rules that Community institutions have a broad discretion to organize their departments and assign staff, on condition that the staff is assigned in the interests of the service and in conformity with the principle of assignment to an equivalent post."}, {"question": "What constitutes a misuse of powers in decision-making?", "answer": "The court states that a decision may amount to a misuse of powers only if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant, and consistent evidence, to have been taken for purposes other than those stated."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the duty to state the reasons on which a decision is based?", "answer": "The purpose of the duty to state the reasons on which a decision is based is both to permit the person concerned to determine whether the decision is defective, making it possible for legality to be challenged, and to enable it to be reviewed by the court."}, {"question": "How is the extent of the duty to state reasons determined?", "answer": "The extent of the duty to state reasons must be determined on the basis of the particular facts of each case, taking into account the context and circumstances surrounding the decision."}, {"question": "Can a decision be annulled due to a failure to state adequate reasons?", "answer": "The court rules that a decision can be annulled if it fails to state adequate reasons, but in this case, the decision, set in its context, cannot be regarded as vitiated by an infringement of essential procedural requirements justifying its annulment."}, {"question": "What are the conditions for assigning an official to a new post?", "answer": "The court states that an official can be assigned to a new post if it is in the interests of the service and in conformity with the principle of assignment to an equivalent post, and if the official has the necessary qualifications and experience for the new post."}, {"question": "Can a decision be considered a misuse of powers if it is taken for disciplinary purposes?", "answer": "The court rules that a decision may be considered a misuse of powers if it is taken for disciplinary purposes, but in this case, the applicant failed to demonstrate convincingly that the President of the Court of Auditors intended to take disciplinary action against him."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs in an unsuccessful application for annulment?", "answer": "The court rules that the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs, but in this case, the Court of Auditors is ordered to pay the whole of the costs, including those of the applicant, due to its failure to provide a proper and express statement of the reasons for the applicant's transfer."}, {"question": "Did the EEC Treaty, specifically Articles 59, 61, 62, and 84, prevent a Member State from levying charges on the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers arriving from or going to a port situated in another Member State, while levying charges only on embarkation at the island port for travel between two ports within national territory, before the entry into force of Council Regulation No 4055/86?", "answer": "The court rules that the EEC Treaty did not prevent a Member State from levying such charges before the entry into force of Council Regulation No 4055/86, as freedom to provide services in maritime transport had not yet been implemented at that time."}, {"question": "Can a Member State introduce new restrictions on the freedom to provide services that had been attained at the date of the entry into force of the Treaty, according to Article 62 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court states that Article 62 does not apply in this case, as the rules in question were reintroduced into the French code des ports maritimes in 1981 after having been repealed in 1969, and Article 61(1) of the Treaty governs freedom to provide services in the field of transport."}, {"question": "Is the freedom to provide services in maritime transport between Member States governed by the provisions of the title relating to transport in the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The court confirms that, according to Article 61(1) of the Treaty, freedom to provide services in the field of transport is to be governed by the provisions of the title relating to transport."}, {"question": "When did the Council adopt measures to achieve freedom to provide services in maritime transport between Member States, and what was the effective date of those measures?", "answer": "The court states that the Council adopted Regulation No 4055/86 on December 22, 1986, which applied the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries, and that regulation entered into force on January 1, 1987."}, {"question": "Does a decision addressed to a Member State by the Commission preclude a national court from restraining conduct by the competent intervention agency that is contrary to national legislation on unfair competition and bonus offers, but adopted in implementation of the decision?", "answer": "The court rules that a decision such as that addressed by the Commission to a Member State precludes a court of that state from restraining conduct on the part of the competent intervention agency which is contrary to national legislation on unfair competition and on bonus offers but which that agency adopted in implementation of the decision."}, {"question": "Are decisions addressed to Member States binding on all organs of the state, including the courts?", "answer": "According to the fourth paragraph of Article 189 of the EEC Treaty, decisions are to be binding in their entirety upon those to whom they are addressed, and in the case of decisions addressed to the Member States, they are binding on all the organs of the state to which they are addressed, including the courts of that state."}, {"question": "Can national courts apply national provisions concerning unfair competition or bonus offers if their implementation would hinder the implementation of a Community decision?", "answer": "The national courts must refrain from applying any national provisions, including those concerning unfair competition or bonus offers, the implementation of which would be likely to hinder the implementation of a Community decision, due to the principle of the precedence of Community law."}, {"question": "Is the validity of Community measures subject to compliance with national law?", "answer": "The validity of Community measures can be judged only in the light of Community law, and cannot be overridden by rules of national law, as this would deprive Community law of its character and call into question the legal basis of the Community itself."}, {"question": "Must Community institutions take into account the principle of fair trading when adopting measures?", "answer": "Community institutions must take into account the principle of fair trading, but must also reconcile this requirement with the aims set out in Article 39 of the EEC Treaty, particularly under the common organization of the agricultural markets."}, {"question": "Can a party introduce a new plea in law for the first time before the Court of Justice that was not raised before the Court of First Instance?", "answer": "No, the Court's jurisdiction in appeals is limited to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance, and allowing a new plea would be to allow a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance."}, {"question": "What is the scope of the Court of Justice's jurisdiction in appeal proceedings?", "answer": "The Court of Justice's jurisdiction is limited to points of law, and it has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or examine the evidence accepted by the Court of First Instance, except where there is a substantive inaccuracy in the findings attributable to the documents submitted."}, {"question": "Can the Court of Justice review the appraisal of facts made by the Court of First Instance?", "answer": "No, the Court of First Instance has exclusive jurisdiction to find the facts and appraise those facts, and such appraisal does not constitute a point of law subject to review by the Court of Justice, unless the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted."}, {"question": "Is the examination of the plausibility of explanations provided by a party subject to review by the Court of Justice in appeal proceedings?", "answer": "No, the examination of the plausibility of explanations forms part of the appraisal of facts and is consequently not subject to review by the Court of Justice in appeal proceedings."}, {"question": "Can a party seek a different form of order in appeal proceedings than was sought at first instance?", "answer": "No, according to Article 113(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, an appeal may seek the same form of order, in whole or in part, as that sought at first instance, and must not seek a different form of order."}, {"question": "What are the conditions for an amended version of an appeal to be considered admissible?", "answer": "The amended version of the appeal must be lodged within the time-limit for bringing an appeal, and the party must clearly show their intention to withdraw the original application and replace it with the new version, as implied by lodging a full, amended version of the original application."}, {"question": "Does the Court of Justice have jurisdiction to interpret Article 3 of the Act of Accession and determine the scope of measures covered by that provision?", "answer": "The Court of Justice has jurisdiction to interpret Article 3 of the Act of Accession, but this jurisdiction is limited to determining the scope of measures covered by that provision, and not for the purpose of defining Member States' obligations under such measures."}, {"question": "Does Article 3(3) of the Act of Accession apply to the decision adopted on 25-27 January 1957 by the representatives of the six original Member States of the ECSC, and does it add to the legal scope of that decision?", "answer": "Article 3(3) of the Act of Accession must be interpreted as applying to the decision adopted on 25-27 January 1957, but it does not add to the legal scope of that decision."}, {"question": "Are Member States prohibited from subjecting to domestic taxation the salaries paid by the European Schools to their teachers, where the burden of such taxation is borne by the Community budget?", "answer": "By virtue of the duty of genuine cooperation and assistance which Member States owe the Community, Member States are prohibited from subjecting to domestic taxation the salaries paid by the European Schools to their teachers, where the burden of such taxation is borne by the Community budget."}, {"question": "Does the obligation to refrain from subjecting teachers' salaries to domestic taxation, as stated in Article 5 of the EEC Treaty, produce direct effects capable of being relied upon in relations between Member States and their subjects?", "answer": "The obligation to refrain from subjecting teachers' salaries to domestic taxation does not produce direct effects capable of being relied upon in relations between Member States and their subjects."}, {"question": "Does Article 7 of the EEC Treaty or any other provision of Community law require a Member State to give effect to the 1957 decision and exempt the salaries of teachers at a European School situated on its territory from domestic taxation, where those teachers are nationals of that Member State?", "answer": "Neither Article 7 of the EEC Treaty nor the general principles of Community law require a Member State to give effect to the 1957 decision and exempt the salaries of teachers at a European School situated on its territory from domestic taxation, where those teachers are nationals of that Member State."}, {"question": "Can the principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Article 7 of the EEC Treaty be applied to situations which are wholly internal to a Member State and which are in no way connected to any situations envisaged by Community law?", "answer": "The principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Article 7 of the EEC Treaty cannot be applied to situations which are wholly internal to a Member State and which are in no way connected to any situations envisaged by Community law."}, {"question": "Does the fact that a Member State grants a tax exemption to teachers of other nationalities, but not to teachers of its own nationality, constitute discrimination on grounds of nationality, contrary to Article 7 of the EEC Treaty?", "answer": "The fact that a Member State grants a tax exemption to teachers of other nationalities, but not to teachers of its own nationality, does not constitute discrimination on grounds of nationality, contrary to Article 7 of the EEC Treaty, as the situation is wholly internal to the Member State and not connected to any situations envisaged by Community law."}, {"question": "Does the second paragraph of Article 78 of the Staff Regulations confer an entitlement to an invalidity pension at the maximum rate when the total permanent invalidity arises from a public-spirited act performed prior to entry into the service of the Communities?", "answer": "The court rules that the second paragraph of Article 78 must be interpreted as not conferring on an official an entitlement to an invalidity pension at the maximum rate where the total permanent invalidity arises from a public-spirited act performed prior to entry into the service of the Communities."}, {"question": "Is a public-spirited act performed prior to entry into the service of the Communities eligible for an invalidity pension under the second paragraph of Article 78?", "answer": "The court states that such an act is not eligible for an invalidity pension under the second paragraph of Article 78, as the provision is intended to exclude events that occurred exclusively prior to the official's entry into the service."}, {"question": "Can the court accept an extensive interpretation of the second paragraph of Article 78, given its exceptional nature?", "answer": "The court suggests that any extensive interpretation of the second paragraph of Article 78 must be undertaken with caution, given its exceptional nature, and that the absence of an indication as to the date at which the public-spirited act must be performed is not a sufficient answer to the question of interpretation raised."}, {"question": "Is the applicant's argument based on a conclusion a contrario drawn from the provision concerning accidents at work acceptable?", "answer": "The court rejects the applicant's argument, stating that the stipulation regarding accidents at work is solely intended to exclude accidents occurring in private life, and that it does not support the applicant's interpretation of the provision concerning public-spirited acts."}, {"question": "Is the interpretation of the second paragraph of Article 78 as excluding events that occurred prior to entry into the service of the Communities consistent with the objectives pursued by the amendment adopted in 1972?", "answer": "The court finds that the interpretation is consonant with the objective of preventing the award of unjustified benefits, and that it does not conflict with the interest of the Communities in ensuring that officials shall not refrain from performing public-spirited acts through fear of economic consequences."}, {"question": "Can a trade mark proprietor oppose the marketing of a pharmaceutical product that has been repackaged by a parallel importer, when the repackaging is necessary for the product to be marketed in the importing State?", "answer": "Yes, but only if the repackaging is not objectively necessary for the product to be marketed in the importing State, and the trade mark proprietor's opposition does not constitute a disguised restriction on trade between Member States."}, {"question": "What constitutes \"artificial partitioning of markets\" in the context of parallel imports of pharmaceutical products?", "answer": "Artificial partitioning of markets occurs when the trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging hinders the effective access of the imported product to the market of the importing State, for example, due to national rules or practices relating to packaging, or where sickness insurance rules make reimbursement of medical expenses depend on a certain packaging."}, {"question": "Is repackaging of pharmaceutical products always necessary to allow the product to be marketed in the importing State?", "answer": "No, repackaging is not always necessary; it is only necessary when it is objectively required to allow the product to be marketed in the importing State, and the trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging would hinder effective access to the market."}, {"question": "Can strong resistance from a significant proportion of consumers to relabelled pharmaceutical products be a valid reason for repackaging?", "answer": "Yes, if the resistance is so strong that it hinders effective market access, repackaging may be objectively necessary to achieve effective market access, and the trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging would constitute a disguised restriction on trade."}, {"question": "Who determines whether repackaging is objectively necessary in a given case?", "answer": "The national court determines whether repackaging is objectively necessary, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time of marketing in the importing Member State."}, {"question": "Can a trade mark proprietor oppose replacement packaging if the parallel importer can reuse the original packaging by affixing labels?", "answer": "Yes, the trade mark proprietor can oppose replacement packaging if the parallel importer can reuse the original packaging by affixing labels, unless the resistance from consumers to relabelled products is so strong that it hinders effective market access."}, {"question": "Is it necessary to examine whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations under Article 5 of the Treaty when it has already failed to fulfill specific obligations imposed by a directive?", "answer": "The court rules that there is no need to examine whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations under Article 5 of the Treaty when it has already failed to fulfill specific obligations imposed by a directive."}, {"question": "What is the consequence for a Member State that fails to bring into force the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with a directive within the prescribed period?", "answer": "The Member State is considered to have failed to fulfill its obligations, as alleged by the Commission, and may be subject to a declaration by the Court and ordered to pay costs."}, {"question": "What is the requirement for Member States under Article 15 of Council Directive 90/167/EEC regarding the transposition of the directive into national law?", "answer": "Member States are required to bring into force the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive before a specified deadline and to inform the Commission thereof."}, {"question": "Can a Member State avoid a declaration of failure to fulfill its obligations by stating that a draft of the necessary laws or regulations is in preparation?", "answer": "No, the court rules that the mere statement that a draft is in preparation is not sufficient to avoid a declaration of failure to fulfill obligations, as the directive has not been transposed within the prescribed period."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs when a Member State is found to have failed to fulfill its obligations under a directive?", "answer": "The unsuccessful party, in this case, the Member State (Kingdom of Belgium), is ordered to pay the costs."}, {"question": "What are the conditions for instituting third-party proceedings to contest a judgment rendered without being heard, as stated in Article 39 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 97(1) of the Rules of Procedure?", "answer": "The conditions are that the judgment is prejudicial to the rights of the third party, and the third party must state how the judgment is prejudicial to its rights and indicate the reasons why it was unable to take part in the original case."}, {"question": "Can a third-party proceeding be instituted if the contested judgment is not prejudicial to the rights of the third party?", "answer": "No, the court rules that a third-party proceeding can only be instituted if the contested judgment is prejudicial to the rights of the third party, meaning it could have altered the third party's legal situation or prevented it from taking legal action to assert its rights."}, {"question": "What is the effect of a judgment dismissing an action because the applicant had assigned its rights to another party?", "answer": "The judgment precludes the applicant from asserting the assigned rights, but it does not necessarily preclude the assignee from asserting those rights, unless the assignee's rights have been time-barred or are otherwise inadmissible."}, {"question": "Can a third party institute proceedings to contest a judgment that dismissed an action because the applicant had assigned its rights, if the third party claims to be an assignee of those rights?", "answer": "No, the court rules that if the judgment would have been dismissed regardless of the identity of the assignee, then the third party's rights could not have been prejudiced by the judgment, and the third-party proceeding is inadmissible."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs of an inadmissible third-party proceeding?", "answer": "The unsuccessful party, in this case, the applicant originating the third-party proceedings, must be ordered to pay the costs of the other parties, while an intervenor who supported the unsuccessful party's conclusions shall pay its own costs."}, {"question": "What conditions must be met for the non-contractual liability of the Community under the second paragraph of Article 215 of the EEC Treaty to arise?", "answer": "The court rules that Community liability depends on the coincidence of a set of conditions, including the unlawfulness of the acts alleged against the institution, the fact of damage, and the existence of a direct link in the chain of causality between the wrongful act and the damage complained of."}, {"question": "Does the price system established under the Common Organization of the Market in Beef and Veal guarantee individual traders that their produce will be disposed of at the precise price level determined by Community rules?", "answer": "The court rules that the price system does not have the effect of guaranteeing to individual traders that their produce will be disposed of at the precise price level determined by Community rules, as it is used to determine the implementation of various measures of intervention in the market and to adjust the level of levies and refunds applicable in trade with non-member states."}, {"question": "Can a producer establish damage solely based on the comparison between the level of prices in their home country and that of prices in another member state?", "answer": "The court rules that this comparison is not convincing, as the producer would have been subject to different economic conditions and monetary compensatory amounts if they had sold their produce in the other member state, and therefore the prices obtained would not have been different from those obtained in their home country."}, {"question": "Is it necessary for the court to examine the unlawfulness of the acts alleged against the institution if the applicant has not proven the existence of damage?", "answer": "The court rules that it is not necessary to examine the unlawfulness of the acts alleged against the institution if the applicant has not proven the existence of damage, as the absence of proof of damage is sufficient for the dismissal of the application."}, {"question": "Who bears the costs of the proceedings in the event of an unsuccessful application?", "answer": "The court rules that the unsuccessful party, in this case the applicant, must be ordered to pay the costs."}, {"question": "Are interveners before the Court of First Instance considered parties before that court for the purposes of Article 115(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice?", "answer": "Yes, according to Article 49 of the EEC Statute of the Court of Justice, interveners before the Court of First Instance are regarded as parties before that court, and therefore, they are not required to submit a fresh application for leave to intervene before the Court of Justice."}, {"question": "Does Article 72(1) of the Staff Regulations establish a minimum threshold for reimbursement ceilings for medical expenses incurred by officials and their families?", "answer": "No, Article 72(1) of the Staff Regulations establishes the maximum rate of reimbursement to which officials and their families are entitled, but it leaves it to the institutions to fix the reimbursement ceilings by agreement between them, without prescribing any minimum thresholds."}, {"question": "Can a plea in law directed against a superabundant ground of a judgment of the Court of First Instance be considered in an appeal?", "answer": "No, a plea in law directed against a superabundant ground of a judgment of the Court of First Instance must be rejected, as it is nugatory and does not affect the outcome of the case."}, {"question": "Is the principle of equality breached if the Commission fails to provide a remedy for a discriminatory situation as soon as it is found to exist?", "answer": "No, the principle of equality does not impose an obligation on the Commission to provide a remedy for a discriminatory situation as soon as it is found to exist, but rather obliges it to demonstrate diligence in achieving a revision of the rules at issue, which takes account of the price of medical services in the various Member States."}, {"question": "Can the Court of Justice consider evidence that was not explicitly examined by the Court of First Instance when assessing the diligence shown by the Commission in providing a remedy for inequalities in reimbursements?", "answer": "No, it is sufficient to observe that it has not been established that the Court of First Instance did not examine the relevant evidence, and therefore, the appellant's criticism of the Court of First Instance's assessment is unfounded."}, {"question": "How are costs shared in proceedings between the Communities and their servants, where the official or servant is the appellant?", "answer": "According to Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs, and where there are several unsuccessful parties, the Court is to decide how the costs are to be shared, unless equity requires otherwise, in which case the Court may order the parties to share the costs."}, {"question": "Can a Member State impose conditions on a fishing vessel to ensure it has a \"real economic link\" with that State when issuing a license to fish against national quotas?", "answer": "Yes, Community law does not preclude a Member State from laying down conditions designed to ensure that a vessel has a real economic link with that State, as long as the link concerns only the relations between the vessel's fishing operations and the populations dependent on fisheries and related industries."}, {"question": "Is it permissible for a Member State to require a fishing vessel to operate from national ports as a condition for fishing against national quotas?", "answer": "Yes, Community law does not preclude a Member State from laying down the condition that a vessel must operate from national ports, as long as this condition does not involve an obligation for the vessel to depart from a national port on all its fishing trips."}, {"question": "Can a Member State accept the landing of a proportion of catches or periodic presence in national ports as evidence of a vessel's operation from national ports?", "answer": "Yes, Community law does not preclude a Member State from taking the position that the fact of a vessel's operation from national ports may be proved by the landing of a proportion of its catches or its periodic presence in national ports."}, {"question": "Is it permissible for a Member State to exclude other evidence of a real economic link between a vessel and the Member State, and only accept the vessel's operation from national ports as evidence?", "answer": "Yes, Community law does not preclude a Member State from accepting, as evidence of compliance with the condition that the vessel must operate from national ports, only the landing of a specified proportion of the vessel's catches or a specified periodic presence of the vessel in national ports, provided that the frequency with which the vessel is required to be present in those ports does not impose, directly or indirectly, an obligation to land the vessel's catches in national ports or hinder normal fishing operations."}, {"question": "Can a Member State introduce new conditions for the grant of licenses to fish against national quotas, or is this precluded by the principle of legitimate expectation?", "answer": "No, Community law does not preclude legislation or a practice of a Member State whereby a new condition not previously stipulated is laid down for the grant of licenses to fish against national quotas, as operators in the fishing industry were not justified in taking the view that the Community rules precluded the making of any changes to the conditions laid down by national legislation or practice."}, {"question": "Does Directive 89/552 preclude a Member State from taking measures against an advertiser in relation to television advertising broadcast from another Member State, provided that those measures do not prevent the retransmission of television broadcasts from that other Member State?", "answer": "No, Directive 89/552 does not preclude a Member State from taking such measures, as long as they do not prevent the retransmission of television broadcasts from another Member State."}, {"question": "Can a Member State take measures against an advertiser in relation to television advertising under Article 30 of the EC Treaty, if those measures affect the marketing of domestic products and products from other Member States in the same way?", "answer": "Yes, a Member State can take such measures under Article 30 of the EC Treaty, provided that they are necessary for meeting overriding requirements of general public importance or one of the aims laid down in Article 36 of the EC Treaty, are proportionate for that purpose, and those aims or overriding requirements could not be met by measures less restrictive of intra-Community trade."}, {"question": "Can a Member State take measures against an advertiser in relation to television advertising under Article 59 of the EC Treaty, if those measures restrict the freedom to provide services?", "answer": "Yes, a Member State can take such measures under Article 59 of the EC Treaty, but it is for the national court to determine whether those provisions are necessary for meeting overriding requirements of general public importance or one of the aims stated in Article 56 of the EC Treaty, whether they are proportionate for that purpose, and whether those aims or overriding requirements could be met by measures less restrictive of intra-Community trade."}, {"question": "Does Directive 89/552 preclude the application of a domestic broadcasting law that prohibits advertisements broadcast in commercial breaks on television from being designed to attract the attention of children under 12 years of age, to television broadcasts from other Member States?", "answer": "Yes, Directive 89/552 precludes the application of such a provision to television broadcasts from other Member States, as it would add a secondary control to the control which the broadcasting Member State must exercise under the Directive."}, {"question": "Can a Member State apply national rules with the general aim of consumer protection to television broadcasts from other Member States, without involving secondary control of television broadcasts?", "answer": "Yes, a Member State can apply such national rules to

interests are centred."}, {"question": "How should the social security legislation be applied to a business representative who is employed in the territories of multiple Member States, prior to the amendment by Regulation No 24/64?", "answer": "The social security legislation to be applied is that of the state in which the principal employment is situated, which is determined by the location of the registered offices of the undertakings the representative works for."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of Article 13 of Regulation No 3, as amended by Regulation No 24/64, in relation to the

their permanent residence."}, {"question": "Does Regulation No 4055/86, in conjunction with Articles 56 and 59 of the EC Treaty, preclude a vessel traffic services system that requires payment of a tariff by sea-going vessels longer than 41 metres, while exempting other vessels such as inland waterway vessels?", "answer": "The court rules that Regulation No 4055/86, in conjunction with Articles 56 and 59 of the EC Treaty, does not preclude such a vessel traffic services system, provided that there is a correlation between the amount of the tariff and the cost of the service from which those sea-going vessels benefit."}, {"question": "Can a restriction on freedom to provide services be justified by overriding reasons in the general interest, and if so, what are the conditions for such justification?", "answer": "The court holds that a restriction on freedom to provide services can be justified by overriding reasons in the general interest, provided that the national legislation is suitable for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and does not go beyond what is necessary to attain it, and that the restriction applies without distinction to all persons or undertakings pursuing an activity in the territory of the host Member State."}, {"question": "Does the protection of public security constitute a valid reason for justifying a restriction on freedom to provide services resulting from a national measure that applies indiscriminately?", "answer": "The court rules that the protection of public security is a valid reason for justifying a restriction on freedom to provide services, and that vessel traffic services supplied within the framework of a vessel traffic services system constitute a nautical service essential to the maintenance of public security in coastal waters and ports."}, {"question": "Is a vessel traffic services system that exempts certain categories of vessels from payment of a tariff considered to be a State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty?", "answer": "The court does not provide a direct answer to this question, as it considers the question to be of no relevance to the outcome of the main proceedings, which concern the requirement for certain companies to pay the tariff, and therefore does not address the issue of State aid in this context."}, {"question": "Does the entry into force of new rules of procedure affect rights of action that accrued before the new rules took effect?", "answer": "The court rules that the entry into force of new rules of procedure affects neither the rights of action

no longer be contested be considered admissible?", "answer": "The court states that such an application is out of time and therefore inadmissible."}, {"question": "Does the absence of a time limit for actions in new rules of procedure revive a right of action that had expired under the former rules?", "answer": "The court rules that the failure to provide a time limit for actions in the new rules of procedure cannot revive a right of action for which the period prescribed in the former rules had expired long before the entry into force of the new rules."}, {"question": "Can an applicant acquire an unlimited right of action if the contested decisions occurred before the entry into force of the previous rules of procedure?", "answer": "The court rejects this view, as one of the main purposes of the previous rules was to place an exact time limit upon the rights of action of servants of the communities, thereby filling a substantial gap in the staff regulations."}, {"question": "Can an action directed against an implied refusal to reply to a letter be considered a new and separate claim?", "answer": "The court rules that if the letter merely reiterates objections already formulated and is directed against the persistence of consequences of a decision taken at an earlier time, the action against the implied refusal constitutes an attempt to acquire a fresh right of action against a decision that can no longer be contested."}, {"question": "How should the text of a provision in a Community regulation be considered when its meaning is doubtful?", "answer": "The

engaged exclusively to work in a Member State other than where the establishment to which they are normally attached is situated be subject to the legislation of the state where the establishment is situated?", "answer": "Yes, such a worker can be subject to the legislation of the state where the establishment is situated, as long as the probable duration of their employment in the territory of the other state does not exceed 12 months."}, {"question": "Can a levy charged on pigs produced in a Member State for slaughter on the domestic market or for live export to other Member States be considered a charge having equivalent effect to customs duties on exports within the meaning of Articles 9, 12, and 16 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The court rules that such a levy does not fall under the prohibition of charges having equivalent effect to customs duties on exports, as it is imposed according to identical criteria on both domestic and exported products."}, {"question": "Under what conditions can a levy charged on pigs produced in a Member State be considered discriminatory internal taxation prohibited by Article 95 of the Treaty?", "answer": "The court states that such a levy may be classified as discriminatory internal taxation if and to the extent to which the advantages deriving from the use made of its revenue compensate in part the charge imposed on pigs produced for slaughter in the Member State concerned, thereby placing at a disadvantage the production of pigs for live export to other Member States."}, {"question": "Does the fact that a national levy is intended to finance an aid scheme authorized by the Commission pursuant to the Treaty provisions on State aid preclude a national court from examining whether such a levy is compatible with other directly effective Treaty provisions?", "answer": "The court rules that the fact that a national levy is intended to finance an aid scheme authorized by the Commission does not preclude a national court from examining whether such a levy is compatible with other directly effective Treaty provisions, such as Articles 12 and 95 of the Treaty."}, {"question": "What is the role of national courts in assessing the compatibility of a parafiscal charge with Treaty provisions other than those concerning State aid?", "answer": "The court states that national courts are best placed to collate the necessary information and carry out the assessments required to determine whether a parafiscal charge is compatible with Treaty provisions other than those concerning State aid, and that they should guarantee individuals the legal protection deriving from the direct effect of Community law provisions."}, {"question": "Can a national court's examination of a levy's compatibility with Treaty provisions other than those concerning State aid encroach on the Commission's exclusive role in determining whether aid is compatible with the common market?", "answer": "The court rules that a national court's examination of a levy's compatibility with Treaty provisions other than those concerning State aid does not encroach on the Commission's exclusive role in determining whether aid is compatible with the common market, as the national court is only assessing the levy's compatibility with directly effective Treaty provisions."}]
